## Taxonomy

The generic name Dermochelys was introduced by Blainville (1816). The specific name
coriacea was first used by Vandelli (1761) and adopted by Linnaeus (1766) (Rhodin and Smith
1982). The binomial refers to the distinctive leathery, scaleless skin of the adult turtle. This
species is the sole member of the taxonomic family Dermochelyidae. All other extant sea
turtles are in the family Cheloniidae. A degree of relationship between Dermochelys and other
living sea turtles has been deduced from behavioral (Carr and Ogren 1959), morphological
(Nick 1912; Zug 1966) and biochemical (Frair 1979, 1982; Chen et al. 1980; Chen and Mao
1981) and genetic (Bowen et al. 1993; Dutton 1995; Dutton et al. 1996) studies. However,
Dermochelys possesses a skeletal morphology unique among turtles (Rhodin et al. 1981), and
recent karyological studies (Medrano et al. 1987) support taxonomic classifications which
segregate extant sea turtle species into two distinct families (Gaffney 1975, 1984; Bickham
and Carr 1983). For the most recent detailed discussion of taxonomy and synonymy, see
Pritchard and Trebbau (1984).

Despite the size dichotomy between mature turtles from eastern and western Pacific nesting colonies, conclusions of evolutionary distinctness may be unwarranted. Genetic differentiation in this species, at least in terms of maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages, is extremely low relative to other species of sea turtle (Dutton et al. 1996). A recent survey of five Atlantic rookeries did not reveal any genetic population structure based on mtDNA, and found similarities between Pacific and Atlantic haplotypes. These data suggest gene flow between rookeries within ocean basins and imply that western Atlantic and eastern Pacific leatherbacks shared a common ancestor in recent evolutionary history (Dutton et al. 1994).
