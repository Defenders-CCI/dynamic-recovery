The leatherback turtle is listed as Endangered throughout its range. In the Pacific, leatherback populations are in severe decline and recovery actions must be given the highest priority. Primary threats to the species are incidental take in coastal and high seas fisheries, and the killing of nesting females and collecting of eggs at the nesting beaches. The United States does not have any nesting of leatherbacks in its jurisdiction in the Pacific, but has important foraging areas on the continental U.S. west coast and near the Hawaiian Islands. It is likely that stocks in U.S. waters originate in Mexico and Central America, though some may originate from Southeast Asia as well. While not directly classified as a threat, the lack of information on the movement patterns and habitat needs of this entirely pelagic species (leatherbacks are the only species which remains pelagic throughout its life) is severely hampering recovery efforts and must be addressed as a high priority.

### Goal
The recovery goal is to delist the species.

### Recovery Criteria
To consider de-listing, all of the following criteria must be met:
  1. All regional stocks that use U.S. waters have been identified to source beaches based on reasonable geographic parameters.
  2. Each stock must average 5,000 (or a biologically reasonable estimate based on the goal of maintaining a stable population in perpetuity) females estimated to nest annually (FENA) over six years.
  3. Nesting populations at "source beaches" are either stable or increasing over a 25-year monitoring period.
  4. Existing foraging areas are maintained as healthy environments.
  5. Foraging populations are exhibiting statistically significant increases at several key foraging grounds within each stock region.
  6. All Priority #1 tasks have been implemented.
  7. A management plan designed to maintain sustained populations of turtles is in place.  

### Actions Needed
Five major actions are needed to achieve recovery (not in order of priority):
  1. Eliminate incidental take of leatherbacks in U.S. and international commercial fisheries.
  2. Support the efforts of Mexico and the countries of Central America to census and protect nesting leatherbacks, their eggs, and nesting beaches.
  3. Determine movement patterns, habitat needs and primary foraging areas for the species throughout its range.
  4. Determine population size and status in U.S. waters through regular aerial or on-water surveys.
  5. Identify stock home ranges using DNA analysis.
