### Goal 

The recovery goal is to delist the species.

### Recovery Criteria 

To consider de-listing, all of the following criteria must be met:
  1. All regional stocks that use U.S. waters have been identified to source beaches based on reasonable geographic parameters.
  2. Each stock must average 5,000 (or a biologically reasonable estimate based on the goal of maintaining a stable population in perpetuity) FENA over six years.
  3. Nesting populations at "source beaches" are either stable or increasing over a 25 year monitoring period.
  4. Existing foraging areas are maintained as healthy environments.
  5. Foraging populations are exhibiting statistically significant increases at several key foraging grounds within each stock region.
  6. All Priority #1 tasks have been implemented.
  7. A management plan designed to maintain sustained populations of turtles is in place.

### Rationale 

Determining quantifiable values that can be used to determine when a sea turtle stock is recovered is quite difficult. The recovery team has tried to make such recommendations as listed above based on best available information with the following conceptual guidelines:
  1. The minimum nesting stock must equal a size that could not easily be eliminated by a single catastrophic event ("natural" or "man induced").
  2. Nesting population trends should be long enough to minimize the effects of natural fluctuations in numbers that are characteristic of sea turtle populations. Generally this time period is equal to the estimated one generation time for each species.
  3. Habitats are adequate to support population growth once threats have been reduced or eliminated.
  4. If a species is to be considered for delisting, a plan must already be in force for maintaining the population in stable or increasing condition. The team was concerned that if a species was delisted, and no management plan was already in force, that the species may be driven back toward extinction too rapidly for resource management agencies to implement such plans.
