### Nesting site trends and causes of declines

_Motivation_

The most recent leatherback sea turtle five-year review indicates the population trends at many large nesting sites is either declining or unknown. Effective allocation of conservation resources requires better knowledge of the status of these populations.

_Approach_

One possible approach is to mobilize citizen scientists to participate in surveys, especially in areas where institutional infrastructure is weak. Guided by local experts, involving people other than professional scientists can both (a) provide much-needed data and (b) improve social understanding of leatherback sea turtle threats and demography.
