### Climate change effects on leatherback sea turtle sex ratios

_Motivation_

Turtles are among the best examples of taxa with environmental sex determination: if eggs incubate above a certain temperature then the individual will be male, otherwise female. While climate change and concomitant sea level rise will have significant habitat loss consequences, a secondary effect could be the steady loss of females because of higher temperatures. The effects of this change on leatherback sea turtles is unknown.

_Approach_

Use a combination of empirical data and modeling to evaluate the spatial and temporal effects of climate change on populations from altered sex ratios.
