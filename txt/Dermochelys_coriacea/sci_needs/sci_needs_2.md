### Ecosystem effects of leatherback sea turtle migration

_Motivation_

Metaecosystems are patchily distributed collections of biotic and abiotic entities and processes. Because of their large size, longevity, extensive migrations, and use of marine and terrestrial environments, leatherback sea turtles have the potential to be significant mediators of metaecosystem processes. The extent to which the decline of leatherback sea turtle populations affects fundamental community processes across space is unknown.

_Approach_

Use a combination of radio tracking data, local community effects, and nutrient flow estimates to model alternative scenarios with and without leatherback sea turtle presence (or changes in abundance).
