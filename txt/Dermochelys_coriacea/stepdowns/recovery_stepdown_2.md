__*2.1 Protect and manage leatherback populations in the marine habitat.*__

Protection of turtles in the marine environment is a priority that is often overlooked as enforcement is difficult and quantification of the problem problematic. However, 99% of a turtle’s life is spent at sea; thus, recovery must include significant efforts to protect turtles at that time. This is particularly significant for the leatherback in U.S. jurisdiction.

__2.1.1 Eliminate directed take of turtles.__

There is no known directed take in U.S. waters however there are still Chilean, Peruvian and Mexican meat harvests. Direct take of turtles is identified as a threat to population recovery in the Pacific Ocean and must be eliminated if sea turtles are to recover.

_2.1.1.1 Reduce directed take of turtles through public education and information._

While increased law enforcement will be effective in the short term, without support of the local populace, regulations will become ineffective. Education of the public as to the value of conserving sea turtles, is a very effective way of sustaining recovery efforts and providing support for enforcement of management regulations.

_2.1.1.2 Maintain the enforcement of protective laws on the part of law enforcement and the courts._

One of the major threats identified for turtle populations in the Pacific is the illegal harvest of turtles both on the nesting beach and in the water. Rigorous efforts in law enforcement should be undertaken immediately to reduce this source of mortality. Such efforts need to include training of enforcement personnel in the importance of protecting turtles, as well as supplying such personnel with adequate logistical support (boats, communication and surveillance equipment etc.). Judges and prosecutors must also be educated in the importance of these matters.

__2.1.2 Determine distribution, abundance, and status in the marine environment.__

In its review of information on sea turtle populations in the Pacific, the Recovery Team found that lack of accurate information on distribution and abundance was one of the greatest threats to sea turtle populations. Most existing information is anecdotal or obsolete and where new information is available, it uniformly indicates that leatherback populations are vastly smaller than commonly believed. We consider that gathering of basic information on distribution and abundance should take a very high priority in the recovery of Pacific leatherback populations.

_2.1.2.1 Determine the distribution and abundance of post-hatchlings, juveniles and adults._

While little is known about the distribution of nesting beaches for the leatherback, even less is understood about distribution of foraging adult and juvenile populations. Quantitative surveys of foraging areas to determine leatherback abundance, and to identify essential habitat are of significant importance for restoration of leatherback populations.

_2.1.2.2 Determine adult (male and female) migration routes and internesting movements._

Like all species of sea turtle (with the possible exception of the Flatback turtle, Natator depressus), leatherbacks migrate from foraging grounds to nesting beaches. These migrations often mean that the turtles move through a variety of political jurisdictions where regulations regarding the stewardship of the species may vary. To preclude the problem of contradictory management strategies by these various jurisdictions, it is important to determine the migration routes leatherbacks follow between nesting and foraging areas. Satellite telemetry studies of both males and females are needed. For U.S. recovery efforts, determination of migratory movements and foraging areas represent highest priority.

_2.1.2.3 Determine growth rates and survivorship of hatchlings, juveniles, and adults, and age at sexual maturity._

Understanding the rates of growth and survivorship of turtle populations is crucial to the development of appropriate population models. This is especially true for leatherbacks for which the least information on growth is available. Such models are important in understanding population status and how best to efficiently apply management efforts, in restoring depleted populations. For example, the application of stage based modeling (Crouse et al. 1987) indicated that not enough effort was being expended on protecting juvenile sized loggerhead sea turtles in the southeastern United States and that without such protection, extensive nesting beach protection was having less positive benefit. A similar approach to understanding leatherback populations should be undertaken, and used to guide restoration policy.

_2.1.2.4 Identify current or potential threats to adults and juveniles on foraging grounds._

Little is known about threats to foraging populations of leatherbacks. Studies on such threats should be undertaken immediately.

__2.1.3 Reduce the effects of entanglement and ingestion of marine debris.__

Entanglement due to abandoned or unmonitored fishing gear, as well as the ingestion of man-made debris is a significant problem in the marine environment.

_2.1.3.1 Evaluate the extent to which leatherbacks ingest persistent debris and become entangled._

Quantification of the extent to which leatherbacks are impacted by marine debris should be undertaken as a first step to mitigating or preventing such impacts. The benefits of such work are that it allows the prioritization of recovery activities and it allows the activities to be efficiently targeted at the problem.

_2.1.3.2 Evaluate the effects of entanglement and ingestion of persistent debris on health and viability of sea turtles._

Because of the remote nature of turtle/debris interactions, the acute and chronic effects of such interaction are not often understood. Turtles may not die immediately after ingesting certain materials, but may become debilitated. Studies to further understand the impacts of such interactions, and what age classes are affected most severely, should be undertaken immediately. As with quantifying the extent to which sea turtles ingest debris, such a program allows recovery efforts to be more efficient.

_2.1.3.3 Formulate and implement measures to reduce or eliminate persistent debris and sources of entanglement in the marine environment._

Once the problem of marine debris has been identified and quantified, it is important to implement (and enforce) a program to reduce the amount of debris in the marine environment, ie. removing the problem entirely, as contrasted to mitigating the problem.

__2.1.4 Monitor and reduce incidental mortality in the commercial and recreational fisheries.__

_2.1.4.1 Monitor incidental mortality in the commercial and recreational fisheries._

Incidental take in fisheries has been identified as a severe threat. These mortalities are associated with international fleets operating on the high seas and fisheries in coastal waters. Monitoring of turtle take by fisheries is extremely important for two reasons. First, it allows resource managers a means to quantify the extent of the problem, and by the very act of monitoring, tends to cause commercial fisherman to be more aware of the concern over incidental take, and thereby encourage reduced take. The choice method for monitoring take is through the use of an unbiased observer program. Voluntary logbooks have not proven a reliable technique for quantifying incidental catch in commercial fisheries. Genetic studies are a valuable tool to identify the nesting stocks being impacted by fisheries in forage areas or migratory corridors.

_2.1.4.2 Reduce incidental mortality in the commercial and recreational fisheries._

Efforts to reduce mortality induced by fisheries include gear modifications or enhancement, and area and seasonal closures. Often a better understanding of the interaction between turtles and fishing gear, and between turtles and their preferred environments can be useful in developing methods to reduce mortality. For example, understanding the influence of bait type or attractors to turtles can help develop less turtle attractive gear. Technological improvements to fishing gear, such as the development of Turtle Excluder Devices (TED’s) is also very important. Finally, closing areas or seasons when fisheries and turtle interactions are highest can limit impacts to turtle populations.

__2.1.5 Eliminate the harassment of turtles at sea through education and enforcement.__

Not applicable to leatherbacks.

__2.1.6 Study the impact of diseases on turtles.__

Little is known about diseases in sea turtles, but there has been recent evidence that it may be a limiting factor in certain populations. Disease origin and transmission may not be limited to the marine environment.

_2.1.6.1 Investigate parasites and other infectious agents._

A variety of other diseases and parasites may be affecting leatherbacks. The prevalence of such infections, their impact on sea turtles, and modes of transmissions need to be studied. Parasites include internal parasites such as blood flukes, external parasites such as leeches (Ozobranchus) and burrowing barnacles (Stephanolepas), and certain bacterial infections such as Vibrios.

__2.1.7 Develop carcass stranding network.__

Stranding networks are operated generally by volunteers who monitor beaches for stranded animals. Such networks can be useful for alerting managers to incidents causing high mortality, such as increased fishery take or disease problems, as well as providing some basic biological data.

__2.1.8 Centralize administration and coordination of tagging programs.__

In general, government resource management agencies can provide the continuity required to coordinate tagging programs. The responsibility of any such agency is that they act as a central distribution point for tags, tagging training and database management. It is critically important that the coordinating agency: 1) provides adequate staff to keep the program organized and respond to tag returns immediately, and 2) remain in existence for many years (20+). Without such a commitment, tagging programs have very limited usefulness, and before initiation of such a program it should be considered carefully on its scientific merits. It must be remembered that sea turtles are long-lived animals, and the most valuable information yielded by any tagging program comes from turtles which have carried identification tags for many years.

Conventional flipper tags generally only last 2 or 3 years in leatherbacks, and other forms of identification, such as Passive Integrated Transponders (PITs) and photoidentification are more appropriate for long-term projects (McDonald and Dutton, In Press). Short-term tagging projects are at best very limited in the information they yield and at worst are nothing more than a form of undue harassment to the turtles. Centralization of tag records is useful as it makes the most efficient use of limited personnel resources, allows standardization of techniques, and can act as a screening mechanism to ensure that tagging is done for valid scientific reasons.

__*2.2 Protect and manage marine habitat, including foraging habitats.*__

Leatherbacks are primarily pelagic, although they often enter nearshore waters. Human activities which degrade important leatherback habitat must be limited.

__2.2.1 Identify important marine habitats.__

These areas are virtually unknown for this species and represent a high priority research need. (Many of these areas will first need to be identified through actions in Section 2.1.2.1 and 2.1.2.2.)

__2.2.2 Ensure the long-term protection of marine habitat.__

Once marine habitats are identified, sea turtle range, refugia and foraging habitats need to be protected to ensure longterm survival for the species. Habitats identified as important or critical should be designated as marine sanctuaries or preserves, while others may require close monitoring. The public needs to be educated on the importance of preserving these habitats.

__2.2.3 Prevent the degradation of marine habitat caused by environmental contaminants such as sewage and other pollutants.__

The effect of such pollution on leatherbacks has not been evaluated. However, leatherbacks are likely prone to concentrating such contaminants within their tissues because of their position in the food web.

__2.2.4 Prevent the degradation or destruction of important habitats caused by upland and coastal erosion and siltation.__

These processes, often made worse by coastal construction, disrupt vital trophic processes, reducing productivity and reducing species diversity. Minimum water standards upstream must be maintained. Land-use decisions must take this into account and associated projects where erosion and siltation occur must be monitored.
