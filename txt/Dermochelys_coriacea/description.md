## Description

Whereas other sea turtles have a carapace containing bony plates covered by horny scutes, the slightly flexible carapace of the leatherback is distinguished by a rubber-like texture. In adults, the carapace (ca. 4 cm thick) is constituted mainly of tough, oil-saturated connective tissue raised into seven prominent ridges and tapered to a blunt point posteriorly.  A nearly continuous layer of small dermal bones lies just below the leathery outer skin of the carapace. The narrow ribs lack pleural flanges and remain widely separated throughout life.  No sharp angle is formed between the carapace and the plastron, resulting in the animal being somewhat barrel-shaped. The scaleless skin and carapace are black with varying degrees of pale spotting. The underside is mottled, pinkish-white and black; the proportion of light to dark pigment is variable. The front flippers are proportionally longer than in other sea turtles and may span 270 cm in an adult. Hatchlings are likewise predominately black, with mottled undersides, but differ in being covered with tiny polygonal or bead-like scales. The flippers are margined in white, and rows of white scales appear as stripes along the length of the back.  Front and rear flippers lack claws. In both adults and hatchlings, the upper jaw bears two tooth-shaped projections, each flanked by deep cusps, at the premaxillary-maxillary sutures. For a detailed discussion of anatomy, including embryonic development, see Deraniyagala (1932, 1936a), Dunlap (1955), Pritchard (1971), and Pritchard and Trebbau (1984).  Curved carapace length (CCL) in adult females nesting in Michoacán, Mexico, during 19801988 averaged 144.9 cm CCL (range 119-176, n=2591) (Laura Sarti M., Universidad Naçional Autonoma de Mexico [UNAM], unpubl. data). In contrast, adult females nesting in eastern Australia average 162.4 cm CCL (Limpus et al. 1984). 

Adults exhibit broad thermal tolerances and are reported in the Pacific as far north as Alaska and the Bering Sea and as far south as Chile and New Zealand (see Insular and Pelagic Range). The core body temperature for adults in cold water has been shown to be several degrees C above ambient (Frair et al. 1972). This may be due to several features, including the thermal inertia of a large body mass, an insulating layer of subepidermal fat, countercurrent heat exchangers in the flippers, potentially heat-generating brown adipose tissue, and a relatively low freezing point for lipids (Mrosovsky and Pritchard 1971; Frair et al.  1972; Greer et al. 1973; Neill and Stevens 1974; Goff and Stenson 1988; Davenport et al.  1990). The skeleton remains highly cartilaginous, even in adult animals, and the species is unique among turtles in showing an extensive cartilage canal vascular system in the long bones (Rhodin et al. 1981).

The East Pacific green turtle is distinguished from the green turtle mainly by size, coloration and carapace shape. The carapace of the adult East Pacific green turtle is narrower, more strongly vaulted and more indented over the rear flippers than that of the green turtle (Cornelius 1986; Márquez 1990). The East Pacific green turtle is also conspicuously smaller and lighter than the green turtle. In the rookeries of Michoacán, Mexico, the mean size for nesting females is 82.0 cm in curved carapace length (CCL) (range 60.0-102, n=718) (Alvarado and Figueroa 1990). On the Galapagos Islands, the mean CCL for nesting females is 80.0 cm (range 74.0-100) (Márquez 1990). The mean straight carapace length (SCL) of nesting females at Playa Naranjo, Costa Rica is 82.9 cm (range 73.0-97.0, n=73) (Cornelius 1976). Adult females weigh between 65 - 125 kgs (Cornelius 1986). Adult males in the rookeries of Mexico are smaller than females with an average CCL of 77.0 cm (range 71.0-85.0, n=32) (Figueroa 1989). Mean hatchling length in Michoacán is 4.5 cm in SCL (range 4.2-5.0, n=140) (Zamora 1990).
