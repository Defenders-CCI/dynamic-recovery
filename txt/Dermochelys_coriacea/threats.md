__Table 1. Threat checklist for leatherback sea turtles in the U.S. Pacific Ocean__ 1 = major problem; 2 = moderate problem; 3 = minor problem; P = known problem, but unknown extent; ? = unknown; - = not a problem

------------------

This section presents a brief overview of threats to leatherbacks in the Pacific basin, followed by summaries of major threats in each U.S.-affiliated island group. A third section then presents more detailed information specific to each island group.  "Threats" to sea turtles are broadly defined as any factor that jeopardizes the survival of turtles or impedes the recovery of their populations. Twenty-two kinds of threats have been identified in this Recovery Plan, but it is readily apparent that all are not equally important and that threats in one Pacific area may not be relevant in another area. Consequently, each island group was evaluated separately based on information received from the Recovery Team and Technical Advisors. Table 2 lists the 11 threats in the marine environment and ranks their significance. Definitions of the threats are provided in subsequent text.  

When viewing Table 2, it should be recognized that there are limitations inherent in this tabulation. First, generalizations are made. Some island groups, such as the Republic of Palau, consist of over 500 islands; consequently, the data presented in Table 2 are limited to a general statement about conditions for the group as a whole. Similarly, most of the island groups possess both sparsely inhabited remote islands and heavily inhabited main islands.  The distribution of turtles and the kinds of threats they face would obviously differ in these two types of islands. Specific information about individual islands, if available, is presented in 'Area-specific Threat Information'. Second, there are data limitations. For most islands, information about turtle threats is sparse (see 'Pacific Synopsis'). Third, the categorization in Table 2 of the extent of each threat, represents the seriousness of the threat within that geopolitical area. Unfortunately it does not necessarily represent the seriousness of the overall threat to the turtle stock.

### Pacific Synopsis
Lack of knowledge concerning the abundance and distribution of leatherbacks under U.S.
jurisdiction (particularly the northeastern Pacific) constitutes a threat, particularly since
important foraging areas have not been identified. Forage areas most likely exist in nearshore
and oceanic areas throughout the northeastern Pacific; however, these vital areas cannot be
given adequate protection until they have been identified. Despite recent legal protection of
animals at nesting beaches in Mexico, these populations continue to decline. The breeding
population origins and migratory habits of the leatherback turtles frequenting the waters of this
region are unknown. Threats to migrating turtles are therefore also unknown. This information
is important to determining their status and necessary for effective management.

__*Regional Summaries*__

__U.S. West Coast__
*Primary turtle threats:*

incidental take in fisheries

Incidental catch poses a threat in pelagic foraging and transit areas and the coastal
feeding grounds and migratory corridors that probably exist along the west coast of the United
States and south into Mexico. Entanglement and ingestion of marine debris, including old
abandoned nets, may continue to pose a threat to leatherbacks, which seem to have a talent
for seeking out and getting tangled in floating lines.

__Hawaii__
*Primary turtle threats:*

incidental take in fisheries

The Hawaiian longline fishery poses the most important threat to leatherbacks, particularly
as fishing effort increases. Research must be undertaken to identify ways of reducing hooking
mortality and modifying techniques to avoid capture.

__American Samoa__
*Primary turtle threats:*

N/A

The reported presence of leatherbacks on American Samoa is very rare. One turtle was killed by an experimental longline fishing boat (Grant 1994), but probably only represents a random event.

__Guam__
*Primary turtle threats:*

N/A

There are no records of nesting by or at-sea sightings of leatherback turtles.

__Republic of Palau__
*Primary turtle threats:*

N/A

There are no records of nesting by or at-sea sightings of leatherback turtles.

__Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas (CNMI)__
*Primary turtle threats:*

N/A

There are no records of nesting by or at-sea sightings of leatherback turtles.

__Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI)__
*Primary turtle threats:*

N/A

There are no records of nesting by or at-sea sightings of leatherback turtles.

__Federated States of Micronesia (FSM)__
*Primary turtle threats:*

N/A

There are no records of nesting by or at-sea sightings of leatherback turtles.

__Unincorporated Islands (Wake, Johnston, Kingman, Palmyra, Jarvis, Howland, Baker, Midway)__
*Primary turtle threats:*

incidental take in fisheries

There are known problems with incidental take in fisheries, but the extent of the problem is
unknown.
