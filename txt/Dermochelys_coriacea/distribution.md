## Distribution

__*Nesting Grounds*__
Some of the largest nesting populations of leatherback turtles in the world border the
Pacific Ocean, but no nesting occurs on beaches under U.S. jurisdiction. Until very recently,
the largest known population, comprising perhaps nearly half the known number of adult
females, nested on the Pacific coast of Mexico, notably in the states of Michoacán, Guerrero
and Oaxaca. Today this population has noticeably declined. Leatherbacks do not generally
nest in the insular Central and South Pacific (exceptions include the Solomon Islands,
Vanuatu, and Fiji). Nesting is widely reported from the western Pacific, including China,
Southeast Asia, Indonesia and Australia.

__Other Areas of the Pacific__

_Eastern Pacific:_

The Pacific coast of Mexico is generally regarded as the most important leatherback breeding ground in the world. Based on a single aerial survey in 1980 (31 October - 1 November) of Michoacán, Guerrero, and Oaxaca, as well as on published and anecdotal data, Pritchard (1982a) estimated that 30,000 females nested annually in these three Mexican states. Lower density nesting was (and still is) reported further north in Jalisco (Pritchard 1971; Márquez 1976) and in Baja California, where the northernmost eastern Pacific nesting sites are found (e.g., Fritts et al. 1982). Today the nesting population is vastly reduced (Table 1, Sarti et al. 1996). The reason for the decline is not clear, but contributing factors surely include the persistent collection of eggs and incidental catch in national and international waters.

Low density nesting is reported from Pacific Central America and peaks in NovemberDecember (Pritchard 1971; Cornelius 1982, 1986). Playa Langosta-Playa Grande, Costa Rica, is a particularly important site, with 1,500 females nesting there in 1990 (J. Spotila, Drexel Univ., pers. comm., 1993). While these areas are not specifically within U.S. jurisdiction, it is likely that females nesting on these beaches forage in or migrate through U.S. waters.

_Northwest Pacific:_

Nesting is reported from China and Thailand, but quantitative data are lacking. In China, Chu-Chien (1982) reports leatherback turtles in Guangdong (Kwangtung), Guangxi (Kwangsi), Fujian (Fukien), Zhejiang (Chekiang), Jiangxi (Kiangsi), Shandong (Shantung), and Liaoning, but does not specify nesting sites, nest density or population sizes. Field surveys were conducted during June-August 1985 in Fujian and Guangdong Provinces, but no evidence of nesting was found (Frazier et al. 1988). Mao (1971) reported that "eggs are eaten wherever available" in Taiwan and the weight of an adult female "photographed at Nanfangao" was 252 kg; nesting sites, if any, were not specified. Nesting apparently does not occur in Korea (Groombridge 1982) or Japan (Uchida and Nishiwaki 1982; Kamezaki 1989). Terengganu, Malaysia, once considered a major nesting area, has declined dramatically from over 2,000 nesting females per year in the 1960's and early 1970's to fewer than 20 females in 1993 (Limpus 1995), largely as a result of intensive egg collection (see Status).  Nesting does not occur in Sabah (de Silva 1982) or Sarawak (Leh 1985).

_Southwest Pacific:_

In Indonesia, at least 13,000 leatherback nests were reported in 1984 on 17.8 km at Irian Jaya (Bhaskar 1985). More recently, about 2,600 leatherbacks were reported nesting at three main sites along 18 km of beach in the northern part of Kepala Burung, Sorong, Irian Jaya (Sutanto Suwelo et al. 1994). In contrast, nesting in eastern Australia is uncommon (1-2 turtles per year) and is restricted to about 160 km of coast northward from Bundaberg (Limpus 1982) near Wreck Rock (Limpus et al. 1984).

Low density nesting occurs widely along the north coast and on some of the larger islands of Papua New Guinea. "Regular nesting sites" include Tulu and Timonai villages on Manus Island, Garu, Kimbe Bay and Ganoi villages in New Britain, along the southeast coast of New Ireland, on Long Island and parts of the mainland of the Madang Province, on Normanby Island in Milne Bay Province, along the coast from Boiken to Turubu in the East Sepik Province, and around Aitape in the West Sepik Province. "Occasional nestings" are reported from Kiriwina and Simsim Islands in the Trobriands, in the Wooklark Islands, on Lou Islands and Tingos village in the Manus Province, and at Pilapila Beach near Rabaul (Spring 1982).  Lockhart (1989) confirmed localized nesting on the north coast and offshore islands, peaking around Christmas; adults and eggs are eaten and some rookeries have been exterminated (e.g., Aua and Wuvulu islands).

In the Solomon Islands, the leatherback nests on "numerous isolated beaches" during November-January, preferring those situated near river mouths, having a reefless approach, and being composed of black sand (Pritchard 1982b). According to Pritchard (1982b), the leatherback is known from the islands of Vanuatu, but no nesting beaches were given. A "very low level of nesting" takes place on the southeastern coast of Vanua Levu, Fiji, the most easterly record of nesting by leatherbacks in the insular Pacific (Pritchard 1982b). Nesting is not reported from the Philippines (Pejabat and Siow 1977), New Caledonia, Tonga, or French Polynesia (Pritchard 1982b), Micronesia (Pritchard 1977, 1982c; Thomas 1989), the Phoenix Islands, Western Samoa, Tokelau, Tuvalu, or the Cook Islands (Balazs 1975, 1982b).

_Insular and Pelagic Range:_

The leatherback is typically associated with continental shelf habitats and pelagic environments. It is uncommon in the insular Pacific, but individuals are sometimes encountered in deep water near prominent archipelagoes. To a large extent, the oceanic distribution of leatherbacks may reflect the distribution and abundance of macroplanktonic prey. Analyses of stomach samples have shown that adults feed primarily on medusae, siphonophores, and salpae in temperate and boreal latitudes (see Foraging Biology and Diet).  Reports of foraging in north Pacific waters include that of Eisenberg and Frazier (1983), who observed an adult feeding on the jellyfish Aurelia off the coast of Washington state. Little information is available on the diet of leatherbacks in northern waters, and on the spatial and temporal distribution of preferred prey species.

Oceanic temperature and bathymetric contours may also be important. The data suggest that leatherbacks occur north of central California during the summer and fall when sea surface temperatures are highest (Dohl et al. 1983; Brueggeman 1991). There is some evidence that leatherbacks follow the 16EC isotherm into Monterey Bay, although the length of their stay "seems more dependent on prey availability than on temperature regimes" (Starbird et al. 1993). Recorded sea surface temperatures at the Oregon and Washington sightings ranged between 13-18.5EC, with the majority in the 15-16EC range (Brueggeman 1991). Some aerial surveys of California, Oregon, and Washington waters suggest that most leatherbacks occur in continental slope waters, while fewer occur over the continental shelf.

_U.S. West Coast_

After analyzing some 363 records of sea turtles sighted along the Pacific coast of North America (from 29E45'N northward), Stinson (1984) concluded that the leatherback was the most common sea turtle in U.S. waters north of Mexico. Sightings and incidental capture data indicate that leatherbacks are found in Alaska as far north as 60.34EN, 145.38EW and as far west as the Aleutian Islands (Hodge 1979; Stinson 1984). Documented encounters extend southward through the waters of British Columbia (Logier and Toner 1961; MacAskie and Forrester 1962), Washington and Oregon (Brueggeman 1991; Washington Dept. Game, unpubl. data; Craig Webster, Northwest Marine Mammal Stranding Network, in litt., 29 October 1990), and California (Lowe and Norris 1955; Dohl et al. 1983; Stinson 1984). There were 96 sightings of leatherbacks within 50 km of Monterey Bay, California, from 1986-1991, mostly by recreational boaters (Starbird et al. 1993). Of 104 records of sea turtle strandings on the U.S.  west coast between 1982 and 1991, 50 were leatherbacks (J. Cordaro, National Marine Fisheries Service [NMFS], pers. comm., 1994).

Further insight into coastal and pelagic range may be gained from reports of incidental catch. In the eastern north Pacific these include entanglement in gillnets off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California (Stick and Hreha 1989; S. Eckert, Hubbs-Sea World Research Institute, pers. comm.). Fishermen "regularly" catch leatherbacks in drift/gill nets off Monterey Bay, central California (C. Starbird, San José State Univ., pers. comm., 1991). A leatherback was killed in October 1990 in a gillnet set in the Bay area (36E55'N, 122E40'W) (S.  Eckert, pers. comm.). See also Threats, Fisheries (Incidental take).

_Hawaii_

Leatherbacks encountered in Hawaii, including those caught incidental to fishing operations, may represent individuals in transit from one part of the Pacific to another (Balazs 1973). Leatherbacks are "regularly sighted" in offshore waters at the southeastern end of the Hawaiian archipelago. In August 1979 at least ten individuals, including juveniles, were sighted in pelagic waters northwest of Hawaii (40-42EN, 175-179EW) (Balazs 1982a).

_American Samoa_

The only leatherback turtle record is that of a juvenile (42.7 cm CCL) caught by longline about 5.6 km south of Swains Island. Water depth at the capture location was about 1,400 m (Grant 1994). mtDNA analysis suggests that this juvenile probably originated in the western Pacific (P. Dutton, Texas A&M Univ. [TAMU], pers. comm., 1995).

_Guam_

During recent aerial surveys of Guam (October 1989-April 1991), 2.6% of the turtles recorded were leatherbacks (G. Davis, Guam, Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources [DAWR], in litt., 22 August 1991).

_Republic of Palau_

Few quantitative data are available concerning the abundance or distribution of leatherbacks in the insular Central Pacific, although fishermen in some areas, such as Palau, readily recognize the species (J. Engbring, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [FWS], pers. comm., 1992). Engbring et al. (1992) reported on the aggressive interactions between a grey reef shark and a leatherback in the lagoon near Koror.

_Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)_

Leatherbacks are occasionally encountered in the pelagic waters of this archipelago.  

Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) 
    No documented sightings.

Federated States of Micronesia (FSM)
    Leatherbacks are infrequently sighted and rarely captured in the FSM states of Truk (=Chuuk), Yap and Pohnpei (McCoy 1974; Pritchard 1977). A leatherback caught near Woleai (Yap) in 1971 was eaten (McCoy 1974). An adult (444 kg, 2.17 m total length) was caught off Parem Reef, Ponape Island (Pritchard 1982c), and a small juvenile (69.4 cm carapace length) captured near Satawal (Yap) was tagged and released (McCoy 1974). More recent data are unavailable.

Unincorporated U.S. Island Territories
    There are no documented sightings in the unincorporated U.S. island territories, although the species may be more common in the Central Pacific than the literature suggests. The territory is vast and poorly surveyed, especially for deep water species.

Other areas in the Pacific

_Eastern Pacific:_

Adults are seasonally abundant off Mexican breeding grounds at Michoacán, Guerrero, and Oaxaca (Márquez 1976; Pritchard 1982a; Sarti et al. 1987, 1989b). The species is also reported from Baja California, Mexico (Smith and Smith 1980; Cliffton et al. 1982). Eleven leatherbacks were captured in gillnets by a single fishermen from Bahia de la Paz, Baja California, from 1985-May 1987 (Alvarado and Figueroa 1990). In the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), juvenile and adult leatherbacks are occasionally caught in tuna purse-seines (S. Eckert, pers. comm.). A small individual (about 15 cm carapace length) was captured in a purse-seine in April 1976 about 180 nautical miles west of San José, Guatemala (11E03'N, 92E20'W) (Robert Pitman, NMFS, pers. comm., 1991). Leatherbacks are found as far south as Chile (Chiloé Island, ca. 42ES: Philippi 1899 in Pritchard 1980; 89 km west of Isla Mocha, 38E22'S, 176E06'W: Frazier and Brito Montero 1990). They are captured in large numbers incidental to the Chilean swordfish fishery (Frazier and Brito Montero 1990).

_Northwest Pacific:_

In the western Pacific the species is found as far north as the Bering Sea (Mys Navarin, USSR, ca. 62EN) (Bannikov et al. 1971) and as far south as Tasmania and New Zealand (Graham 1964; McCann 1969; Eggleston 1971). In China, Zhou (1983) documented 10 adult and subadult leatherbacks (112- 135 cm carapace length, n=7) caught by the local fisheries from the coastal waters of Jiangsu Province, 1980-1982. Several were captured in coastal waters near Lüsi, one near Lianyungang Port (a city near the border with Shandong Province to the north), and another one near Haimen, a delta city of the Yangtze River. Further to the south, Frazier et al. (1988) examined nine adult and subadult specimens (mean=131.8 cm CCL, range 115.5-152.5, n=7) captured in the waters of Fujian and Guangdong Provinces during May-October; the largest and smallest specimens were both males.

In the waters of Korea, leatherbacks have been found near Mokp'o, Cholla Namdo Province, South Korea (Doi 1936 in Shannon 1956) and off Pyongwon county, South Pyongan Province, North Korea (Tong and Yon 1961 in Szyndlar 1991). Mao (1971) quotes fishermen who say that the species is "frequently captured from October to March, and occasionally in other months" in Taiwan; during the "prosperous season" two to five individuals (most >150 kg) could be seen on the wharf in a single day. Multiple sightings have been documented in the waters of Japan (Pritchard 1980; Uchida and Nishiwaki 1982), including a subadult (120 cm straight carapace length [SCL]) that died after becoming entangled in a gill net off Hyogo Prefecture (Balazs 1985).

Adults are present at least seasonally in the waters of the South China Sea, as nesting occurs in Malaysia and Indonesia (see Nesting Areas and Habits) and incidental catch in this region has been documented (Aikanathan and Kavanagh 1988; Chan et al. 1988). Hundreds of leatherbacks are accidentally caught each year in drift/gill nets set in the South China Sea and north Pacific (Wetherall et al. 1993).

_Southwest Pacific:_

The leatherback is known to occur in Indonesia (very few data are available, see Polunin and Nuitja 1982), Papua New Guinea (PNG), Australia, and New Zealand. After extensive interviewing, Lockhart (1989) concluded that the leatherback is found in deep water off PNG, particularly off the north coast, and was more abundant in the past than it is today. Limpus and McLachlan (1979) report concentrations of non-nesting leatherbacks in inshore waters off central eastern Australia, judging by incidental catch records from the shark netting industry; sightings are infrequent inshore of the Great Barrier Reef and across northern Australia.  Leatherbacks are also caught in shark nets in southeastern Australia, primarily during the summer (December peak) (Limpus and McLachlan 1979). A number of immature specimens have been seen in the Gulf of Carpentaria; "some are being caught in set nets (only a few in trawls) but the magnitude is not known at this time" (J. Miller, in litt., 27 July 1992). Eggleston (1971) summarized sightings from New Zealand and concluded that the species "may be a regular visitor ... it is certainly the most frequently recorded New Zealand turtle."

_South Central Pacific:_

Few quantitative data are available concerning the abundance or distribution of leatherbacks in the insular Pacific. The leatherback is not typically associated with insular habitats, particularly those characterized by coral reefs or other potentially injurious surroundings, but individuals are occasionally encountered in deep water near prominent archipelagoes, such as the Philippines (de Celis 1982). The species has been documented in deep water near the Cook Islands (Brandon 1977 in Balazs 1982b) and two captures are reported from French Polynesia (Fretey and Lebeau 1985; Fretey 1987).
