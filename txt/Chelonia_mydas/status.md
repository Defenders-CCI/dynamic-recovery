__*THREATENED BREEDING POPULATIONS*__

Current nesting abundance trends were determined for 23 threatened nesting concentrations among 11 ocean regions around the world. They included both large and small rookeries and are believed to be representative of the overall trends for their respective regions. Of these 23 sites for which data enable an assessment of current trends, 10 nesting populations are increasing, 9 are stable, and 4 are decreasing. Long-term continuous datasets ≥20 years are available for 9 threatened population sites, all of which are either increasing or stable. These include Ascension Island, Hawaii, Heron Island, Ogasawara Islands, Philippine Turtle Islands, Sabah Turtle Islands, Sarawak, Terengganu, and Tortuguero. Despite the apparent global increase in numbers, the positive overall trend should be viewed cautiously because trend data are available for just over half of all sites examined. With respect to regional trends, data from index sites suggest that some regions are doing better than others based on available trend data. Nesting populations are doing relatively well (# increasing sites > # decreasing sites) in the Pacific, Western Atlantic, and Central Atlantic Ocean. In contrast, populations are doing relatively poorly in Southeast Asia, Eastern Indian Ocean, and perhaps the Mediterranean.

Threats to nesting and marine habitats continue to affect threatened green turtle populations.  Continuing human population expansion into coastal areas is expected to increase the severity of existing threats and is therefore a cause for major concern. Green turtles are also highly vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts during all life-stages, and three of the biggest threats result from harvest for commercial and subsistence use (e.g., egg harvest, the harvest of females on nesting beaches, and directed hunting of green turtles in foraging areas).  Diseases, particularly fibropapillomatosis, threaten a large number of existing subpopulations. Fisheries bycatch in artisanal and industrial fishing gear is also a major impact. These fisheries practices include drift-netting, long-lining, set-netting, pound netting, and trawl fisheries, and their adverse impacts on sea turtles have been documented in marine environments throughout the world. In addition, increasing incidence of exposure to heavy metals and other contaminants in the marine environment is of concern in some areas.  Additional factors affecting green turtles include boat traffic and its modification of green turtle behavior in coastal areas, boat strikes as a major mortality source in some areas, the ingestion of and entanglement in marine debris that can reduce food intake and digestive capacity, and the interaction with oil spills.

__*ENDANGERED FLORIDA BREEDING POPULATION*__

The green turtle nesting population of Florida appears to be increasing based on 18 years (1989-2006) of index nesting data from throughout the state. Although in the last four years there are three 'low' years, this may be due to lesser reproductive effort as a result of environmental variability at foraging grounds rather than a decrease in the number of nesting females. The increase in nesting in Florida is likely a result of several factors, including: (1) a Florida statute enacted in the early 1970s that prohibited the killing of green turtles in Florida; (2) the species listing under the ESA in 1973, affording complete protection to eggs, juveniles, and adults in all U.S. waters; (3) the passage of Florida's constitutional net ban amendment in 1994 and its subsequent enactment, making it illegal to use any gillnets or other entangling nets in state waters; (4) the likelihood that the majority of Florida adult green turtles reside within Florida waters where they are fully protected; (5) the protections afforded Florida green turtles while they inhabit the waters of other nations that have enacted strong sea turtle conservation measures (e.g., Bermuda); and (6) the listing of the species on Appendix I of CITES, which stopped international trade and reduced incentives for illegal trade from the U.S.

While nesting has increased, impacts to nesting beaches and the marine environment have also increased. Among the most significant threats to nesting habitat in Florida are structural impacts (e.g., construction of buildings, beach armoring, and beach renourishment) and beachfront lighting. These activities result in direct habitat destruction and degradation decreasing the extent and suitability of nesting sites on Florida beaches (e.g., increased erosion, altered thermal profiles). The high incidence of fibropapillomatosis disease among some foraging populations is a serious concern. Within U.S. waters, fisheries bycatch of Florida green turtles remains a threat. Human threats (e.g., directed killing, fisheries bycatch) outside of Florida may have profound impacts on the Florida breeding population because of the dispersal of Florida green turtles to juvenile foraging areas throughout the Wider Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Vessel strikes are a growing concern and, as human populations increase in coastal areas, vessel strikes are likely to increase.

__*ENDANGERED PACIFIC MEXICO BREEDING POPULATION*__

There is one primary nesting concentration in Pacific Mexico (Colola, Michoacan) and three lesser nesting sites (Maruata, Michoacan; Clarion Island, Revillagigedos Archipelago; and Socorro Island, Revillagigedos Archipelago). Based on nesting beach monitoring efforts, a mean of roughly 6,050 nests are deposited each year in Pacific Mexico. The only long-term trend data available are for Colola, the largest nesting concentration in Pacific Mexico, where nesting beach monitoring has been ongoing every year since the 1981-1982 nesting season.  Based on the 25-year trend line, it is clear that green turtle nesting has increased since the population's low point in the mid 1980s to mid 1990s. This observed increase may have resulted from the onset of nesting beach protection in 1979 - as is suggested by the similarity in timing between the onset of beach conservation and the age-to-maturity for green turtles in Pacific Mexico. The initial upward turn in annual nesting was seen in 1996, about 17 years after the initiation of a nesting beach protection program, and growth data from the Gulf of California suggest that green turtles mature at about 15-25 years. Although not a clear cause of the increasing nesting trend, the consistency in timing is nonetheless compelling. The 1990 presidential decree protecting all sea turtles of Mexico certainly helped the situation, but this occurred much later than the start of nesting beach conservation. It is more likely that this national legislation has had its greatest positive impact at the foraging areas, where green turtle hunting was once rampant.

Impacts to green turtle habitat are diverse and widespread in Pacific Mexico. Several of the lesser green turtle nesting beaches in Mexico suffer from coastal development, a problem that is especially acute at Maruata, a tourist site with tourist activity and heavy foot traffic during the nesting season. Artificial lighting is also a problem in many of these areas. Other significant impacts on nesting beach habitat include disturbances from feral and domestic animals. Coastal development also constitutes a major threat to marine habitats in several areas, perhaps none more so than in northwest Mexico where the development of a large marina network is planned for at least five major foraging areas. Green turtles are also highly vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts during all life-stages, and three of the biggest threats result from harvest for commercial and subsistence use (e.g., egg harvest, the harvest of females on nesting beaches, and directed hunting of green turtles in foraging areas).  Because of the dispersal of green turtles nesting in Pacific Mexico to areas throughout the Eastern Pacific Ocean, human threats (e.g., global warming, fisheries bycatch, contamination) outside of Mexico may have profound impacts on the local breeding population.

### From 1998 recovery plan

The leatherback sea turtle is listed as Endangered throughout its entire range under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended. Similarly, the species is classified as Endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources' (IUCN) Red Data Book, where taxa so classified are considered to be "in danger of extinction and whose survival is unlikely if the causal factors continue operating" (Groombridge 1982).  Leatherbacks are included in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a designation which effectively bans trade in specimens or products except by special permit. Such permit must show that the trade is not detrimental to the survival of the species and is not for primarily commercial purposes (Lyster 1985). There is no commercial trade in leatherback sea turtles or their parts or products at the present time (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987; Mack et al. 1982). Neither Critical Habitat (under the aegis of the ESA) nor any protected areas have been established for this species in the U.S. Pacific, largely because nesting is not known to occur and important foraging areas have not been identified.

Leatherbacks are seriously declining at all major Pacific basin rookeries, including Irian Jaya (Indonesia), Terengganu (Malaysia), and Michoacán (Mexico). At least 13,000 leatherback nests were reported in 1984 on 17.8 km of coast extending eastward from Tanjung Jamursba on the Bird's Head Peninsula, Irian Jaya (Bhaskar 1985). In 1991, Betz and Welch (1992) visited the site and reported that nesting levels had declined to a mere 25% of those reported by Bhaskar; the near total collection of eggs has most certainly contributed to the population's demise. Similarly, the beach at Rantau Abang, Terengganu, has experienced a dramatic decline as a result of intensive egg collection. The data show a steady drop in nesting activity from nearly 11,000 landings in 1956 to 6,721 landings in 1968 to 280 in 1990 (Hendrikson and Alfred 1961; Chua 1988; Mortimer, WWF-Malaysia, in litt., 29 August 1991).  Almost 2,000 females were tagged at Terengganu in 1970, while fewer than 20 females nested in 1993 (Limpus, 1995), largely as a result of intensive egg collection (see Status).  Nesting does not occur in Sabah (de Silva 1982) or Sarawak (Leh 1985). In the case of Mexiquillo, Michoacán, an estimated 4,796 nests were laid on 4.5 km of beach in 1986-1987 and approximately 1,074 nests were laid in 1989-1990 (L. Sarti M., UNAM, unpubl. data). It is not yet clear whether the Mexican decline reflects natural fluctuation, but based on aerial survey data of Sarti et al. 1996 a geographic shift in nesting is unlikely. This decline represents a warning that the population is in serious jeopardy. Nevertheless, it is the contention of those close to the situation that the population is in very serious danger of collapse. Population declines have also been reported in India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand (see Ross and Barwani 1982).

No attempt has yet been made to assess the status of foraging populations. Despite occasional reports of leatherbacks sighted at sea, and a growing database documenting their incidental catch in coastal and pelagic fisheries, there are very few areas where the species is routinely encountered. Exceptions include Monterey Bay, California (Starbird et al. 1993) and southern Queensland and central New South Wales, Australia (Limpus and McLachan 1979).
