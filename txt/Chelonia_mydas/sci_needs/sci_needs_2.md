### Ecosystem effects of green sea turtle migration

_Motivation_

Metaecosystems are patchily distributed collections of biotic and abiotic entities and processes. Because of their large size, longevity, extensive migrations, and use of marine and terrestrial environments, green sea turtles have the potential to be significant mediators of metaecosystem processes. The extent to which the decline of green sea turtle populations affects fundamental community processes across space is unknown.

_Approach_

Use a combination of radio tracking data, local community effects, and nutrient flow estimates to model alternative scenarios with and without green sea turtle presence (or changes in abundance).
