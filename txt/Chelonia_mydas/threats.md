__Table 1. Threat checklist for East Pacific green sea turtles in the U.S. Pacific Ocean__ 1 = major problem; 2 = moderate problem; 3 = minor problem; P = known problem, but unknown extent; ? = unknown; - = not a problem

This section presents a brief overview of threats to East Pacific green turtles, followed by summaries of major threats in each U.S.-affiliated area. A third section then presents more detailed information specific to each area where this species occurs. "Threats" to sea turtles are broadly defined as any factor that jeopardizes the survival of turtles or impedes population recovery. These threat categories are presented, but it is readily apparent that not all are equally important and that threats in one area may not be relevant in another. Consequently, each political jurisdiction was evaluated separately based on information received from the Pacific Sea
Turtle Recovery Team and Technical Advisors. (see Table 1).

#### Pacific Synopsis
Lack of knowledge concerning the abundance and distribution of Chelonia in the northeastern Pacific constitutes a threat, particularly since important foraging grounds have not been specifically identified. Forage areas most likely exist in bays and inlets along the coast of Baja California (Mexico) and southern California (United States), however, these vital areas cannot be given adequate protection until they have been identified. The breeding population origins and migratory habits of East Pacific green turtles frequenting waters off the west coast of the United States are unknown. Threats to migrating turtles are, therefore, also unknown. This information is important for effective management.

#### Regional Summaries
__*U.S. West Coast*__

_Primary turtle threats:_
  - debris
  - boat collisions
  - incidental capture

The primary threats to the species in U.S. waters include incidental capture by coastal fisheries, boat impacts and water pollution.

*Other U.S. Areas*

_Primary turtle threats:_

  - N/A

This regional population does not extend to other U.S. jurisdictions.
