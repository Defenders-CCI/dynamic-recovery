### Banning

We have created these dynamic, interactive recovery plans with discussion tools to encourage engagement. However, we reserve the right to [ban]("http://blog.codinghorror.com/suspension-ban-or-hellban/") any individual who detracts from the discussion by not following the contributing guidelines. Criticism is fine...when it is constructive. But unconstructive, insulting, or otherwise inappropriate materials will be removed and we will ban the offenders.
