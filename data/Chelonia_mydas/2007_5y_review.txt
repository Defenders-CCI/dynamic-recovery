    1.2. Methodology Used to Complete the Review
         Dr. Jeffrey Seminoff of the National Marine Fisheries Service gathered and synthesized
         information regarding the status of the green sea turtle (Section 2.3). This review was
         subsequently compiled by a team of biologists from the National Marine Fisheries
         Service's (NMFS) Office of Protected Resources and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
         Service's (FWS) Southeast Regional Office and the Jacksonville Ecological Services
         Field Office. Our sources include the final rule listing this species under the Act; the
         recovery plans; peer reviewed scientific publications; unpublished field observations by
         the Services, State, and other experienced biologists; unpublished survey reports; and
         notes and communications from other qualified biologists. The draft 5-year review was
         sent out for peer review to six academic professionals with expertise on the species and
         its habitats. Peer reviewers were provided guidance to follow during the review
         process. Comments received from peer reviewers were incorporated into the 5-year
         review document (see Appendix). The public notice for this review was published on
         April 21, 2005, with a 90 day comment period (70 FR 20734). A few comments were
         received and incorporated as appropriate into the 5-year review.
    1.3  Background
         1.3.1   FR notice citation announcing initiation of this review
                 April 21, 2005 (70 FR 20734)
         1.3.2   Listing history
                 Original Listing
                 FR notice: 43 FR 32800
                 Date listed: July 28, 1978
                 Entity listed: Two populations
                   Endangered Population - breeding colony populations in Florida and on
                   Pacific coast of Mexico
                                                1

        Threatened Population - wherever found except where listed as endangered
      Classification: Endangered and Threatened
1.3.3 Associated rulemakings
      Regulations Consolidation Final Rule: 64 FR 14052, March 23, 1999. The
      purpose of this rule was to make the regulations regarding implementation of
      the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) by NMFS for marine species more
      concise, better organized, and therefore easier for the public to use.
      Critical Habitat Designation: 63 FR 46693, September 2, 1998. The purpose of
      this rule was to designate marine critical habitat for the green turtle as follows:
      Culebra Island, Puerto Rico – Waters surrounding the island of Culebra from
      the mean high water line seaward to 3 nautical miles (5.6 km). These waters
      include Culebra’s outlying Keys including Cayo Norte, Cayo Ballena, Cayos
      Geniquí, Isla Culebrita, Arrecife Culebrita, Cayo de Luis PeZa, Las Hermanas,
      El Mono, Cayo Lobo, Cayo Lobito, Cayo Botijuela, Alcarraza, Los Gemelos,
      and Piedra Steven.
1.3.4 Review history
      Plotkin, P.T. (Editor). 1995. National Marine Fisheries Service and U.S. Fish
      and Wildlife Service Status Reviews for Sea Turtles Listed under the
      Endangered Species Act of 1973. National Marine Fisheries Service, Silver
      Spring, Maryland. 139 pages.
      Conclusion: The review was conducted on the East Pacific Green Turtle only,
      and the conclusion was to retain the listing as endangered throughout its range.
      Mager, A.M., Jr. 1985. Five-year status reviews of sea turtles listed under the
      Endangered Species Act of 1973. U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA,
      National Marine Fisheries Service, St. Petersburg, Florida. 90 pages.
      Conclusion: Retain the listing as endangered in Florida and on the Pacific coast
      of Mexico and threatened in the rest of its range.
      FWS also conducted 5-year reviews for the green turtle in 1983 (48 FR 55100)
      and in 1991 (56 FR 56882). In these reviews, the status of many species was
      simultaneously evaluated with no in-depth assessment of the five factors or
      threats as they pertain to the individual species. The notices stated that FWS
      was seeking any new or additional information reflecting the necessity of a
      change in the status of the species under review. The notices indicated that if
      significant data were available warranting a change in a species' classification,
      the Service would propose a rule to modify the species' status. No change in the
      green turtle's listing classification was recommended from these 5-year reviews.
1.3.5 Species' recovery priority number at start of review
      National Marine Fisheries Service = 5 (this represents a moderate magnitude of
      threat, a high recovery potential, and the presence of conflict with economic
      activities).

2.0 REVIEW ANALYSIS
2.1 Application of the 1996 Distinct Population Segment (DPS) policy
    2.1.1   Is the species under review a vertebrate?
            Yes.
    2.1.2   Is the species under review listed as a DPS?
            No. It is listed as two populations (listed before November 1978 when DPS language
            was added to the ESA).
    2.1.3   Is there relevant new information for this species regarding the application of
            the DPS policy?
            Yes. Although at this time, based on the best available information, the Services
            believe the current population listing is valid, we have information that indicates an
            analysis and review of the species should be conducted in the future to determine the
            application of the DPS policy to the green turtle. See Section 2.3 for new information
            since the last 5-year review and Section 4.0 for additional information.
2.2 Recovery Criteria
    2.2.1   Does the species have a final, approved recovery plan containing objective,
            measurable criteria?
                                                 3

No. The "Recovery Plan for U.S. Population of Atlantic Green Turtle (Chelonia
mydas)" was signed in 1991, the "Recovery Plan for U.S. Pacific Populations of the
Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas)" was signed in 1998, and the "Recovery Plan for U.S.
Pacific Populations of the East Pacific Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas)" was signed in
1998. While not all of the recovery criteria strictly adhere to all elements of the 2004
NMFS Interim Recovery Planning Guidance, they are still a useful measure of the
species status. See Section 4.0 for additional information.
The recovery criteria for the three active recovery plans are identified below, along
with several key accomplishments:
1991 Recovery Plan for U.S. Population of Atlantic Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas):
The U.S. population of green turtles can be considered for delisting if, over a period
of 25 years, the following conditions are met:
1. The level of nesting in Florida has increased to an average of 5,000 nests per year
    for at least 6 years.
    - Green turtle nesting in Florida over the past 6 years has been documented as
      follows: 2001 - 581 nests, 2002 - 9,201 nests, 2003 - 2,262 nests, 2004 - 3,577
      nests, 2005 - 9,644 nests, and 2006 - 4,970 nests. This averages to 5,039 nests
      annually over the past 6 years.
2. At least 25 percent (105 km) of all available nesting beaches (420 km) is in public
    ownership and encompasses greater than 50 percent of the nesting activity.
    - Efforts are underway to determine the extent of green turtle nesting beaches
      within conservation lands in public (federal, state, or local government)
      ownership and privately owned conservation lands (e.g., non-profit conservation
      foundations).
    - The Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge, located in Brevard and Indian River
      Counties, Florida, was established in 1991 and protects important nesting
      habitat. Currently 9 km (60%) of the 15.0 km of beach targeted for protection
      have been acquired by FWS and its partners. With the addition of the
      previously established Sebastian Inlet State Park (5 km), a total of 14 km of
      oceanfront habitat is protected within the 33-km stretch. A total of 6 km is
      needed to complete acquisition of the Archie Carr NWR.
3. A reduction in stage class mortality is reflected in higher counts of individuals on
    foraging grounds.
    - The Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network (STSSN) is ongoing in the
      Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico to document sea turtle mortality. Strandings are
      used as an index of at-sea mortality and provide valuable biological information
      on food habits and reproductive condition. Analysis of stranding data has been
      important in assessing regulations designed to protect sea turtles from fishery-
      related mortality.
    - Vital population assessment work has been conducted under the STSSN,
      including genetic sampling and analysis of age classes.
                                     4

   - Population identification has been conducted on turtles caught as bycatch in
     fisheries, foraging turtles, and stranded turtles using DNA analysis, flipper
     tagging, and satellite telemetry.
   - U.S. longline fishery observer programs have been established to monitor,
     report, and estimate green turtle bycatch.
   - Fishing gear technologies, including improvements to turtle excluder devices
     (TEDs) and modifications to scallop dredges and pound net leaders, have been
     developed and tested to reduce sea turtle bycatch.
   - Prohibitions on the use of large-mesh gillnets have been enacted to reduce
     entanglement and mortality.
4. All priority one tasks have been successfully implemented.
   - The Florida Index Nesting Beach Survey program was established in 1989 to
     monitor trends in nesting activity (task 211).
   - Nest success is evaluated and nest protection measures are implemented on
     national wildlife refuges throughout the Southeast U.S. and U.S. Caribbean
     (task 212).
   - In-water population studies in the Atlantic and Caribbean are underway to
     provide indices of turtle abundance (task 2211).
   - Regulations requiring year-round use of TEDs by most shrimp trawlers
     operating in southeastern U.S. waters were required after December 1992 and
     modifications to improve turtle exclusion have been codified (task 2221).
   - Long-term monitoring and research of potential causes of and threats posed by
     fibropapillomatosis is underway. Fibropapillomatosis is a disease that is
     characterized by the presence of internal and/or external tumors
     (fibropapillomas) that may grow large enough to hamper swimming, vision,
     feeding, and potential escape from predators (task 227).
1998 Recovery Plan for U.S. Pacific Populations of the Green Turtle (Chelonia
mydas):
To consider de-listing, all of the following criteria must be met:
1. All regional stocks that use U.S. waters have been identified to source beaches
   based on reasonable geographic parameters.
   - Stock structure of nesting turtles has been identified using DNA analysis,
     flipper tagging, and satellite telemetry.

     been conducted.
6. All priority #1 tasks have been implemented.
   - Efforts are ongoing to reduce directed take through public education and
     information (tasks 1.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.1).
   - Law enforcement activities to prevent illegal exploitation and harassment are
     ongoing (tasks 1.1.1.2 and 2.1.1.2).

     mitigation requirements, including safe handling, gear removal, and release of
     turtles caught incidental to the fishery (task 2.1.4).
   - Fishery mitigation experiments have been conducted in Hawaiian longline and
     shoreline fisheries (task 2.1.4).
                                      6

7. A management plan to maintain sustained populations of turtles is in place.
   - Not yet completed.
8. International agreements are in place to protect shared stocks.
   - The U.S. is a party to the South Pacific Regional Environment Program, which
     has goals to promote cooperation in the Pacific Islands region and to provide
     assistance to ensure sustainable development for present and future generations.
     Sea turtles are among the focal animal groups within this program.
1998 Recovery Plan for U.S. Pacific Populations of the East Pacific Green Turtle
(Chelonia mydas):
To consider de-listing, all of the following criteria must be met:
1. All regional stocks that use U.S. waters have been identified to source beaches
   based on reasonable geographic parameters.
   - Stock structure of nesting turtles has been identified using DNA analysis,
     flipper tagging, and satellite telemetry.
   - Population identification has been conducted on turtles caught as bycatch in
     fisheries, foraging turtles, and stranded turtles using DNA analysis, flipper
     tagging, and satellite telemetry.
2. Each stock must average 5,000 (or a biologically reasonable estimate based on the
   goal of maintaining a stable population in perpetuity) females estimated to nest
   annually (FENA) over six years.
   - A mean of roughly 6,050 nests has been deposited each year in Pacific Mexico
     (see Table 4 for additional information). The long-term (25-year) trend in
     nesting activity for Colola, the largest nesting concentration in Pacific Mexico,
     has increased since the population's low point in the mid 1980s to mid 1990s.
3. Nesting populations at "source beaches" are either stable or increasing over a 25-
   year monitoring period.
   - Aerial surveys of nesting areas in Mexico have been supported.
   - Monitoring and protection efforts of nesting beaches in Mexico, Galapagos
     Islands, and Costa Rica have been supported.
   - The only long-term trend data available are for Colola, the largest nesting
     concentration in Pacific Mexico, where nesting beach monitoring has been
     ongoing every year since the 1981-1982 nesting season. Based on the 25-year
     trend line, it is clear that green turtle nesting has increased since the population's
     low point in the mid 1980s to mid 1990s.
4. Existing foraging areas are maintained as healthy environments.
   - Efforts to attain this goal are ongoing.
5. Foraging populations are exhibiting statistically significant increases at several
   key foraging grounds within each stock region.
   - Resident green turtles in south San Diego Bay, California; Galapagos Islands;
     Chile, Peru; and Pacific Mexico have been monitored and tracked.
                                       7

                - Monitoring efforts on index areas in Baja California, Mexico, to obtain
                   information on abundance, mortality, and biology, have been supported.
                - Aerial surveys of foraging areas in Mexico have been supported.
            6. All priority #1 tasks have been implemented.
                - An observer program in Peru to document the threat of shark and mahi mahi
                   longline fisheries on green turtles has been supported (task 2.1.4).
                - An observer program in the Chilean swordfish-directed longline fishery has
                   been supported and provided circle hooks and technical support for
                   experimental testing of modified gear (task 2.1.4).

                - Turtle excluder device outreach and training efforts with various foreign
                   governments have been conducted (task 2.1.4).
            7. A management plan to maintain sustained populations of turtles is in place.
                - Not yet completed.
            8. International agreements are in place to protect shared stocks.
                - The U.S. is a party to the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and
                   Conservation of Sea Turtles.
2.3 Updated Information and Current Species Status
    The green sea turtle was once abundant in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the
    world. Over the last century, this species has declined in most areas and stands at only a
    fraction of its historical abundance. These declines resulted in the listing of green turtles on
    the U.S. Endangered Species Act as threatened globally, except for the Florida and Pacific
    coast of Mexico breeding populations, which are listed as endangered (43 FR 32800). In
    accordance with these separate listings, this ESA review is divided into three subsections: A)
    threatened breeding populations distributed globally, B) the endangered breeding population
    in Florida, and C) the endangered breeding population in Pacific Mexico. These subsections
    are not intended to be exhaustive reviews of all new information pertaining to green turtles in
    each area, but instead focus on new information that is relevant for determining if a change in
    ESA status is warranted.
    SUBSECTION A: THREATENED BREEDING POPULATIONS
    A.2.3.1 Biology and Habitat
              A.2.3.1.1 New information on the species' biology and life history:
                           Green turtles are highly mobile and they undertake complex movements
                           through geographically disparate habitats during their lifetimes (Musick
                           and Limpus 1997, Plotkin 2003). The periodic migration between
                           nesting sites and foraging areas by adults is a prominent feature of their
                           life history. Early flipper tagging studies demonstrated that female
                           green turtles are philopatric to specific nesting beaches, returning to the
                           same beach in subsequent nesting seasons (Carr et al. 1978). Genetic
                                                   8

techniques clarified that these are also their natal beaches (Meylan et al.
1990). Thus, after departing as hatchlings and residing in a variety of
marine habitats for up to 40 or more years (Limpus and Chaloupka
1997), green turtles make their way back to the same beach from which
they originated. The timing of females' return trips for nesting, both
within a season and between seasons, and their nesting biology have
been the focus of extensive research for many years. Through
examining green turtle nesting in the context of oceanography, it is clear
that environmental periodicity is a major determinant in the timing of
green turtle reproduction (Limpus and Nichols 1988, Chaloupka 2001,
Solow et al. 2002). It is also apparent that during years of heavy nesting
activity, density dependent factors (e.g., beach crowding, digging up of
eggs by nesting females) may impact nesting activity and hatchling
production (Tiwari et al. 2005, 2006), which in turn can affect a
population's growth rate and recovery potential (Mazaris and Matsinos
2006). While substantial research continues to describe nesting biology,
one of the most notable advances in sea turtle research has been the
expansion of efforts to study turtles in the marine environment. As a
result we are gaining a better understanding of the biology of all life
phases.
Research on green turtles in marine habitats has addressed a variety of
questions. Areas of particular advance include information on green
turtle growth (Bresette and Gorham 2001, Bjorndal et al. 2000, Seminoff
et al. 2002c, Balazs and Chaloupka 2004b, Chaloupka et al. 2004b) and
age-to-maturity (Seminoff et al. 2002c, Zug et al. 2002, Balazs and
Chaloupka 2004b, Chaloupka et al. 2004a). Coupled with the recent
studies of demography and survivorship (see Subsection A.2.3.1.2.3),
these data are paramount for developing accurate population models.
We have also learned more about post-nesting migrations (Luschi et al.
1998, Cheng 2000, Godley et al. 2002, Craig et al. 2004, Kennett et al.
2004, Troëng et al. 2005), which has illuminated migratory corridors as
well as their foraging area destinations. We now know that green turtles
often return to the same foraging areas following subsequent nesting
migrations (Godley et al. 2002; Broderick et al. 2006a; P. Dutton,
NMFS, unpublished data; B. Schroeder, NMFS, personal
communication, 2007), and once there, they move within specific areas,
or home ranges, where they routinely visit specific localities for foraging
and resting (Seminoff et al. 2002a, Godley et al. 2003, Makowski et al.
2006, Seminoff and Jones 2006, Taquet et al. 2006). However, it is also
apparent that some green turtles remain in open ocean habitats for
extended periods; perhaps never recruiting to coastal foraging sites
(Pelletier et al. 2003; Seminoff et al. in review; J. Alfaro-Shigueto,
Asociacion Pro Delphinus Peru, unpublished data). While offshore, and
sometimes while in coastal habitats, green turtles are not obligate
herbivores as widely believed, and instead consume invertebrates such
as jellyfish, sponges, sea pens, and pelagic prey (i.e., prey that occupy
the water column) (Godley et al. 1998, Heithaus et al. 2002, Seminoff et
al. 2002b, Hatase et al. 2006, Parker and Balazs in press). Additional
                         9

          facets of green turtle biology that have been the subject of recent studies
          include their ecological roles (Moran and Bjorndal 2005, Aragones et al.
          2006), diving behavior (Hochscheid et al. 1999; Hays et al. 2000, 2001,
          2002; Southwood et al. 2003; Seminoff et al. 2006), and endocrine
          biology (Jessop et al. 1999, Hamann et al. 2000, Jessop and Hamann
          2004).
          Despite these advances, there are numerous gaps in our understanding of
          green turtle biology. We still lack sufficient information on basic
          demographic aspects such as growth and age-to-maturity for the vast
          majority of global subpopulations. Information on annual reproductive
          output is similarly scant for many of these sites. In the marine
          environment, the oceanic phase of juveniles (i.e., the "lost years")
          remains one of the most poorly understood aspects of green turtle life
          history, both in terms of where turtles occur and how long they remain
          oceanic. At-sea mortality in fisheries is also an area for which few data
          are available. The paucity of information regarding these aspects
          continues to inhibit effective modeling of populations and prevents a full
          understanding of which nesting concentrations are most at risk.
          Recent efforts to characterize the status of green turtles have
          underscored the need to address many of these information deficiencies
          (Seminoff 2004, Chaloupka et al. 2004b). However, to achieve this
          understanding will require a concerted effort from biologists, modelers,
          and wildlife managers throughout the world. There is a major need for
          additional demographic information, which will require rigorous tagging
          programs coupled with studies using molecular tools such as genetics
          and stable isotopes. Achieving recovery of depleted green turtle
          populations will require international partnerships and information
          exchange, as well as protection strategies that encompass all life history
          phases.
A.2.3.1.2 Abundance, trends, demography, and demographic trends:
          A.2.3.1.2.1. Abundance and trends
          Current nesting abundance is provided for 46 threatened and endangered
          nesting concentrations among 11 ocean regions around the world (Figure
          1). Current nesting abundance trends were determined for 23 of the
          threatened populations. These include both large and small rookeries
          and are believed to be representative of the overall trends for their
          respective regions. Although the smaller sites may not contribute
          substantially to the overall number of turtles nesting, they represent
          genetic diversity within each region and their status is therefore highly
          relevant to this evaluation. The ocean regions include: Western-,
          Central-, and Eastern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Western-,
          Northern, and Eastern Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, and Western-,
          Central-, and Eastern Pacific Ocean.

Figure 1. Map showing the location of the 46 green turtle nesting concentrations that
were focused on for this evaluation. See Table 1 for site names and current annual
nesting levels. Sites 1, 43, and 44 are listed as endangered (see Subsections B and C).
             Estimates of current abundance are largely based on annual numbers of
             nesting females or deposited nests at each site. In some cases,
             abundance is based on egg production or egg harvest rates. Annual
             reproductive effort (in females, nests, or eggs) is determined during
             beach monitoring programs during which reproductive effort is
             quantified on a fixed length of beach over the course of a nesting season
             (Schroeder and Murphy 1999). In the few cases where egg production
             or egg harvest data are provided, this information was reported to state
             agencies by egg collectors and vendors. Because green turtle nesting
             activity at a given beach is often highly variable from year to year
             (Miller 1997), estimates of abundance are based on mean nesting
             activity over the course of multiple nesting seasons (at least five seasons
             if possible). In some cases, empirical data for single seasons are
             presented; however, these are not used to assess current nesting trends,
             even if they are suggestive of a specific population trajectory when
             compared to historic data.
             In addition to the current abundance at each site, the total combined
             annual reproductive effort (number of nesting females) for all sites is
             presented. To estimate number of females from nest and egg counts,
             conversions are based on published values for eggs/female/season or
             nests/female/season for the site in question. If no data are available,
             then calculations are based on a mean of 100 eggs/nest and 3
             nests/season (Hirth 1997). The application of these conversion factors
             are based on the assumptions that the mean number of eggs/nest and
             nests/female/season differ insignificantly through time, and that efforts
             to monitor nesting female activity and egg production are consistent
             through time. When using egg harvest data, we also assumed that
                                     11

harvest effort was consistent during all years for which data are
available.
As with any assessment based on long term data, there is a level of
uncertainty relating to the final results of this report. It should be noted
that a major caveat of using the annual number of nesting females to
assess population trends is that this data type provides information for
the proportion of the adult females that nest in any given year, not the
total adult female population. This limitation is heightened by the high
inter-annual variability in magnitude of nesting by green turtles, and the
potential that the proportion of a population's adult female cohort nesting
each year oscillates over decadal or longer time frames (Limpus and
Nichols 1988, Miller 1997).
To characterize the quality of data used to estimate current abundance,
this report uses a letter grading system (A, B, C; Table 1). An 'A' is
given to those data sources that are either in peer-reviewed published
literature or are based on unpublished data collected by highly
dependable experts; a 'B' is given when data are from gray literature, and
a 'C' is used when data come from personal communications for which
the data precision is not fully verifiable, or when the estimate is
imprecise. It should be noted that the grade given for confidence in data
is independent of the time duration for which the estimate is based. In
other words, a letter grade of 'A' is given for peer-reviewed data, even if
it represents only a single nesting season.
In addition to mean annual reproductive effort among these sites, we
calculate the change in reproductive effort based on published values of
former versus current nesting levels. To this extent, this report does not
present robust modeling exercises, but rather provides a summary of the
empirical data available for each nesting concentration. It is implicitly
acknowledged that most green turtle populations are depleted relative to
their historic abundance; however, this evaluation focuses on current
abundance and population trends, irrespective of how nesting numbers
compare to historic data. Population trends are determined by
comparing the current nesting abundance with that from some earlier
period, preferably ≥ 20 years in the past. A summary of these trends is
given in Table 1, where the symbols ▲, ▼, and ▬ are used to indicate
if a population is increasing, declining, or stable, respectively. The
symbol '?' is used when data are insufficient to make a trend
determination or the 'most recent' values are not current (15 years or
older).

                                    Based on the mean annual reproductive effort, 108,761 to 150,521
                                    females nest each year among the 46 sites included in this evaluation.
                                    This is a crude estimate of total reproductive output because not all sites
                                    are covered and some data are for single years; however, it does provide
                                    a starting point for estimating the annual global nesting effort because
                                    most of the major nesting concentrations are included in this analysis.
                                    It is important to note that green turtles nest in areas other than those
                                    highlighted in this report; however, these sites are not believed to
                                    contain nesting levels high enough to change their overall status and are
                                    therefore not covered here. Overall, of the 23 threatened population
                                    sites for which data enable an assessment of current trends, 10 nesting
                                    populations are increasing, 9 are stable, and 4 are decreasing. Long-
                                    term continuous datasets ≥20 years are available for 9 sites, all of which
                                    are either increasing or stable. These include Ascension Island, Hawaii,
                                    Heron Island, Ogasawara Islands, Philippine Turtle Islands, Sabah Turtle
                                    Islands, Sarawak, Terengganu, and Tortuguero. Despite the apparent
                                    global increase in numbers, the positive overall trend should be viewed
                                    cautiously because trend data are available for just over half of all sites
                                    examined. Further, the need for caution is underscored by the fact that
                                    none of the data sets spans a full green turtle generation (age to maturity
                                    + ½ reproductive longevity), which may be up to 50 years (Seminoff
                                    2004). This suggests that impacts occurring over four decades ago that
                                    caused a change in juvenile recruitment rates may have yet to be
                                    manifested as a change in nesting abundance.
                                    With respect to regional trends it is clear that among the 'index sites'
                                    examined in this evaluation, some regions seem to be doing better than
                                    others based on available trend data. Nesting populations are doing
                                    relatively well (# increasing sites > # decreasing sites) in the Pacific,
                                    Western Atlantic, and Central Atlantic Ocean. In contrast, populations
                                    are doing relatively poorly in Southeast Asia, Eastern Indian Ocean, and
                                    perhaps the Mediterranean. Trend analyses specifically for the
                                    threatened populations are described below, summarized by region.
                                    Western Atlantic Ocean
                                    For the threatened breeding populations, there are five nesting
                                    concentrations of particular interest in the Western Atlantic/Caribbean,
                                    all of which are stable or increasing. These include Yucatan Peninsula
                                                              14

(Mexico), Tortuguero (Costa Rica), Aves Island (Venezuela), Galibi
Reserve (Suriname), and Isla Trindade (Brazil).
Along the Yucatan Peninsula, daily nesting beach reconnaissance efforts
suggest that nesting has increased over the last two decades. In the early
1980s, about 875 nests/year were deposited, but by 2000 this had
increased to over 1,500 nests/year (Instituto Nacional de Pesca,
unpublished data).
By far the most important nesting concentration for green turtles in the
western Atlantic is in Tortuguero, Costa Rica. Nesting has increased
markedly since the early 1970s. From 1971-1975, there were
approximately 41,250 emergences per year and from 1992-1996 there
were approximately 72,200 emergences per year (based on the following
equation: nesting on the entire Tortuguero beach = 1.65*nesting effort
along the northern 18-km section of Tortuguero beach, where 1.65
represents the ratio of total nesting emergences on the entire Tortuguero
beach to nesting emergences in the northern 18-km section; Bjorndal et
al. 1999). Although these data are given in emergences (which include
nesting and non-nesting events), they are nonetheless suggestive of a
dramatic increase in green turtle abundance at Tortuguero. Based on a
recent account from Troëng and Rankin (2005), this population is still
on the rise: from 1999-2003, a total of about 104,411 nests/year was
deposited, which corresponds to approximately 17,402-37,290 nesting
females each year. This increase has occurred despite the fact that there
have been substantial human impacts to this population, both at the
nesting beach and at foraging areas (Troëng 1998, Troëng and Rankin
González 2000, Campbell and Lagueux 2005). In Nicaragua, the
primary foraging area for this nesting stock, Campbell and Lagueux
(2005) report large juvenile and adult survivorship at 0.55, likely due to
the ongoing directed take of green turtles in this area.
At Aves Island, Venezuela, the population appears stable to slightly
increasing. From 1984-1987, 700-900 nests (about 230-300 females)
per season were counted; in 1997, a total of 267 females nested (V.
Vera, Dirección General de Fauna, personal communication to K.
Eckert, WIDECAST, 2001); and in 2005 and 2006, a total of 335 and
443 females nested, respectively (Vera and Montilla 2006, Vera 2007).
The nesting concentration at Galibi Reserve in Suriname is stable. From
1975-1979, 1,657 females were counted (Schulz 1982), a number that
increased to a mean of 1,740 females from 1983-1987 (Mohadin in
Ogren 1989), and to 1,803 females in 1995 (Weijerman et al. 1998).
The southernmost nesting concentration in the Western Atlantic is at Isla
Trindade, Brazil. This nesting population has been stable with a mean
of about 1,500-2,000 females nesting per year since the early 1980s
(Moreira et al. 1995, Moreira and Bjorndal 2006).
                        15

Central Atlantic Ocean
The only nesting concentration in the central Atlantic is at Ascension
Island (United Kingdom). This population has increased substantially
over the last three decades (Broderick et al. 2006b). Mortimer and Carr
(1987) counted 5,257 nests in 1977 (about 1,500 females), and 10,764
nests in 1978 (about 3,000 females) whereas from 1999-2004, a total of
about 3,500 females nested each year (Broderick et al. 2006b). These
data are suggestive of an increase, although historic data from additional
years are needed to fully substantiate this trend.
Eastern Atlantic Ocean
There are two areas of interest in the eastern Atlantic Ocean: Bioko
Island (Equatorial Guinea) and the Bijagos Archipelago (Guinea-
Bissau). Nesting at Bioko Island appears to have decreased, whereas
nesting in the Bijagos Archipelago may be stable; however, the lack of
long-term and/or multiple year data sets precludes meaningful trend
assessment for both sites. At Bioko, the number of nightly emergences
during the peak of the nesting season declined from 200-300 females per
night during the 1940s (Eisentraut 1964) to 50-100 females per night in
the 1980s (Tomas et al. 1999; J. Tomas, University of Valencia-Spain,
personal communication, 2001). During the 1996-1997 and 1997-1998
nesting seasons, a mean of 1,468 nests were deposited (approximately
500 females; Tomas et al. 1999). In the Bijagos Archipelago, Parris and
Agardy (1993, cited in Fretey 2001) reported approximately 2,000
females per season from 1990-1992, and Catry et al. (2002) reported
approximately 2,500 females nesting during the 2000 season.
Mediterranean Sea
There are four nesting concentrations in the Mediterranean from which
data are available, including those in Turkey, Cyprus, Israel, and Syria.
Currently, approximately 300-400 females nest each year - about two-
thirds of which nest in Turkey and one-third in Cyprus. Although this
population is depleted from historic levels (Kasparek et al. 2001),
nesting data gathered since the early 1990s in Turkey, Cyprus, and Israel
show no apparent trend in any direction. However, a declining trend is
apparent along the coast of Palestine/Israel, where 300-350 nests were
deposited each year in the 1950s (Sella 1982) compared to a mean of 6
nests per year from 1993-2004 (Kuller 1999; Y. Levy, Israeli Sea Turtle
Rescue Center, unpublished data.).
A recent discovery of green turtle nesting in Syria adds roughly 100
nests per year to green turtle nesting activity in the Mediterranean (Rees
et al. 2005). That such a major nesting concentration could have gone
unnoticed until recently (the Syria coast was surveyed in 1991, but
nesting activity was attributed to loggerheads (Caretta caretta)) bodes
                        16

well for the ongoing speculation that the unsurveyed coast of Libya may
also host substantial nesting.
Western Indian Ocean
Green turtle nesting concentrations in this region include Eparces Islands
(Tromelin, Europa, and Glorieuses), the Comoros Islands, the Seychelles
Islands (Aldabra and Assumption), and Kenya. In the Eparces Islands,
nesting is increasing at Glorieuses, and decreasing at Europa and
Tromelin (M. Taquet, Institut National Agronomique de Paris-Grignon,
France, personal communication, 2002). However, published data are
needed to corroborate these trends, since only very wide ranges have
been reported so far, and only for Europa and Tromelin Islands (see
below).
At Europa and Tromelin, the annual number of nesting females was
reported at 4,000-5,000 in the early 1970s by Hughes (1970), and 9,000-
18,000 in the late 1970s by Lebeau et al. (1983). Further, Le Gall et al.
(1986) give an estimate of 2,000-11,000 females per year for the mid
1970s to mid 1980s. With such wide ranging estimates, it is not
currently possible to determine the current nesting trend at these islands.
In the Comoros Islands, there were approximately 1,850 females per
year in the early 1970s (Frazier 1985), and about 5,000 females in 2000
(S. Ahamada, AIDEnvironment-Comoros, personal communication,
2001). However since the more recent datum is unverified, this trend
should be viewed with caution.
At the Seychelles Islands, green turtles are currently increasing in
number, although the population remains depleted relative to historic
levels (Mortimer et al. 2006). The annual number of nesting females at
Aldabra and Assumption during the early 1900s was approximately
12,000 females based on information collected during the organized
exploitation of the species for calipee production (Mortimer 1985), and
by the onset of protective measures in 1968 that number had dropped to
approximately 1,700 females (Mortimer 1984). Since then, however, the
number of females nesting in the Seychelles has increased. For
example, at Aldabra the nesting activity increased from about 1,700
nests/year during 1981-1984 to about 4,500 nests/year from 1995-2002
(Mortimer et al. 2006).
In Kenya, approximately 200-300 females nested each year from 1999 to
2004 (Okemwa and Wamukota 2006); however, there are not sufficient
data to determine the current population trend.
                       17

Northern Indian Ocean
Seven rookeries are examined in the Northern Indian Ocean: Hawkes
Bay and Sandspit (Pakistan), Gujarat (India), Karan Island (Saudi
Arabia), Ras al Hadd (Oman), and Sharma (Peoples Democratic
Republic of Yemen), Jana and Juraid Islands (Saudi Arabia), and Sri
Lanka. Declines are evident at Hawkes Bay and Sandspit where a mean
of approximately 1,300 nests were deposited annually from 1981-1985
(Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989) and a mean of approximately 600
nests were laid from 1994-1997 (Asrar 1999). At Gujarat, 866 nests
were deposited in 1981 (Bhaskar 1984) and 461 nests in 2000 (Sunderraj
et al. 2006). However, since these two data points are for single years it
is not possible to determine a trend. At Sharma, counts of nightly
nesters during peak nesting season in 1966 and 1972 (30-40 females;
Hirth 1968, Hirth and Hollingworth 1973) versus the same index during
the peak of the 1999 nesting season (15 females; Saad 1999) are
suggestive of a decline. However, the lack of multiple-year data sets for
both Sharma and Gujarat preclude trend assessment. This is particularly
true since Saad (1999) only worked at one beach predominantly, while
estimates from Hirth (1968) and Hirth and Hollingsworth (1973)
represented a greater area (N. Pilcher, Marine Research Foundation,
personal communication, 2007).
Nesting may be stable at beaches in Karan Island and Ras Al Hadd,
although updated nesting numbers are urgently needed. At Karan Island
(Saudi Arabia), 500-1,000 females nested annually during the 1970s
(Basson et al. 1977), and during the 1991 and 1992 seasons, 559 and
408 females nested, respectively (Pilcher 2000). At Ras al Hadd
(Oman), Ross and Barwani (1982) reported about 6,000 females nesting
each year for the period 1977-1979, and Ross (in Groombridge and
Luxmoore 1989) described the same number for the late 1980s.
Although annual nesting totals have not been published since the 1980s,
monitoring in the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s by park rangers
indicate that nesting during peak periods ranges from 200-400
females/night (AlKindi et al. 2003), and approximately 44,000 nests
were recorded in 2005 for Ras al Hadd and Ras al Jinz nesting beaches
(S. Al-Saady, Ministry of Regional Municipalities, Environment and
Water Resources, personal communication, 2007), thus confirming that
Oman remains one of the most important nesting concentrations of green
turtles in the Indian Ocean, if not the entire world.
In Saudi Arabia, data are available for two seasons from Karan Island
(1991 and 1992) and only a single season from both Jana and Juraid
Islands (1991), indicating that approximately 600 nests are deposited
each year between these sites (Pilcher 2000). However, the fact that so
few years of nesting data are available suggests that this figure should be
used cautiously if attempting to derive an annual mean. At Sri Lanka, a
mean of 184 females nested each year from 1996-2000 (Kapurisinghe
2006), but as with other short term data sets, no trend can be established.
                        18

Eastern Indian Ocean
The current status is described for four nesting concentrations in the
Eastern Indian Ocean: Suka Made (Indonesia), Pangumbahan
(Indonesia), Thamihla Kyun (Myanmar), and western Australia.
Relative to the neighboring regions of the Northern Indian Ocean and
Southeast Asia, populations in the Eastern Indian Ocean appear
substantially depleted. Information for Suka Made (Meru Betiri
National Park, East Java, Indonesia) suggests that nesting has declined
since the early 1970s. Schulz (1987) reports a mean of approximately
1,500 nests from 1970-1974, which is substantially greater than the
mean of 395 nests per year from 1991-1995 as reported by Arrinal
(unpublished data via C. Limpus, Queensland Parks and Wildlife
Service, personal communication, 2002). At Pahgumbahan (West Java,
Indonesia), the mean annual egg harvest was 2.5 million eggs in the
1950s and 400,000 eggs in the 1980s (Schulz 1987). This apparent
decline should be interpreted cautiously since it could be reflective of a
decline in collection efforts rather than a decline in egg production. At
Thamihla Kyun, Maxwell (1911, cited in Groombridge and Luxmoore
1989) reported a mean annual egg harvest of about 1.74 million eggs
from 1883-1898. In 1999, less than 250,000 eggs were harvested
(Thorbjarnarson et al. 2000). Yet, despite the apparent declines at
Pahgumbahan and Thamihla Kyun, the lack of recent and/or multiple
year datasets prevents an assessment of the current trends at these sites.
For western Australia, there are four primary nesting concentrations,
located at North West Cape, and on the islands of Lacepede, Scott Reef,
and Ashmore Reef. Few data are available, although it has been
estimated that the mean annual number of nests is somewhere between
3,000 and 30,000 (R.I.T. Prince, Australia Wildlife Research Centre,
personal communication, 2001). Although data are not sufficient to
draw any conclusions regarding long-term trends in western Australia,
these sites together may constitute the most important green turtle
nesting concentration in the Indian Ocean.
Southeast Asia
Population trends are described for nine nesting concentrations in the
Southeast Asia region. These include Gulf of Thailand, Vietnam, Berau
Islands and Enu Island (Indonesia), Philippine Turtle Islands, Sabah
Turtle Islands, Sipadan, Sarawak, and Terengganu (all in Malaysia).
Data suggest that populations are currently stable at all but Thailand,
Vietnam, and perhaps Berau Island, although updated information is
needed for this site.
Annual nesting in the Gulf of Thailand has decreased from a mean of
approximately 405 nests per year between 1975-1983 to a mean of
approximately 250 nests per year from 1992-2001 (Charuchinda and
Monanunsap 1998; M. Charuchinda, Marine Fisheries Division Mannai
Island, Thailand, personal communication, 2002).
                       19

In Vietnam, the only site for which monitoring has occurred for an
appreciable period is Con Dao National Park, monitored since 1995.
Here, annual nesting of green turtles has remained relatively stable, with
an annual mean from 1995-2003 of 239 females (World Wildlife Fund,
unpublished data, and Nguyen Thi Dao 1999, cited in Hamman et al.
2006a). Outside of Con Dao, there appear to have been substantial
decreases. For example, prior to the 1960s, approximately 500 females
nested each year along the mainland beaches and near-shore islands of
south-central Vietnam and approximately 100 females nested each year
on islands in the Gulf of Tonkin (Hamann et al. 2006a). However, aside
from Con Dao, breeding populations of green turtles in Vietnam have
declined significantly and probably number approximately 10 nests per
year in both the Gulf of Tonkin and south-central Vietnam mainland
coast (Hamann et al. 2006a).
In the Aru Islands, nesting beach monitoring has been ongoing
sporadically at Enu Island since the late 1970s (K. Dethmers, University
of Canberra, personal communication, 2007). Although there appears to
have been a decline during the ensuing years, the lack of continuous
monitoring prevents an assessment of the current trend at this site.
Nevertheless, data collected in 1997 (540 nesting females) suggest that
this site is an important nesting area for green turtles in Southeast Asia
(Dethmers 2000; K. Dethmers, University of Canberra, Australia,
unpublished data).
In the Berau Islands (northeast Kalimantan, Indonesia), green turtle
nesting has substantially decreased over the last 60 years. Schulz (1984)
estimated that approximately 36,000 females nested each season in the
1940s, with roughly 200 females/night during the peak of the nesting
seasons. In the mid 1980s, approximately 4,000-5,000 females nested
each season, with about 25 females/night during the peak nesting periods
(Schulz 1984). However, the data for the 1940s has not been verified
and may be reflective of number of nests rather than females (N. Pilcher,
Marine Research Foundation, personal communication, 2007). This
potential coupled with the lack of more recent data precludes trend
analysis for this site.
At the Philippine and Sabah (Malaysia) Turtle Islands, both considered
to be part of the same nesting population in the Sulu Sea (Moritz et al.
2002), information based on annual egg production and egg harvest
indicates that nesting has increased at the Sabah Islands and remained
stable at the Philippine Islands. At Sabah, a mean of approximately
550,000 eggs were harvested annually from 1965-1968 (de Silva 1982);
this number dropped to approximately 250,000 in the early 1980s
(Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989), but had increased to nearly 1
million eggs by the late 1990s (E. Chan, Institute of Oceanography,
Kolej Universeti Sains dan Teknogli, Malaysia, personal
communication, 2002). It should be noted, however, that from 1965-
                        20

1968 data represent eggs harvested, whereas during subsequent years
data represent eggs incubated or protected, which is not reflective of
total production, and Pilcher (2000) suggested that effort and data
accuracy were dependable only after 1985. However, this potential
underestimation for the later years adds further support to the increasing
trend for Sabah green turtles. In the Philippine Turtle Islands, egg
production remained fairly stable from 1984-2000, with an annual mean
of about 1.4 million eggs per year (Cruz 2002).
At the Sipadan (Malaysia) rookery, Chan (2006) reports that nesting
levels have been fairly consistent each year from 1995 to 1999,
numbering about 800 nests/year, with relatively little inter-annual
variation in abundance.
In Sarawak and Terengganu (Malaysia), it appears that nesting
abundance has been stable for 20 years or more. At Sarawak,
approximately 2,000 nests were deposited per year from 1970-2001, and
at Terengganu, about 2,200 nests per year were laid from 1984-2000
(Liew 2002, Chan 2006). It should be noted, however, that data since
1927 (Banks 1937) suggests that the current population, although stable,
is dramatically reduced from historical levels.
Western Pacific
Trends are presented for four sites in the Western Pacific: Heron Island
(southern Great Barrier Reef (sGBR), Australia), Raine Island (northern
Great Barrier Reef (nGBR), Australia), Guam (USA territory), and
Ogasawara Islands (Japan). Three sites have shown an increase in
abundance, while a fourth (Guam) appears stable.
At Heron Island (sGBR), Chaloupka and Limpus (2001) found an
increase in annual nesting abundance of approximately 3% per year
from 1974-1998. The mean annual abundance from 1993-1998 was
about 560 females (Limpus et al. 2002). More recently, based on data
through 2002, Chaloupka et al. (in review) reported a mean annual
growth rate of 3.8% for the Heron Island rookery. The increase in
annual nesting at Heron Island is concurrent with an observed increase
of 8% per year from 1985-1992 for the green turtle population in
southern Great Barrier Reef waters (Chaloupka and Limpus 2001).
At Raine Island (nGBR), the population has apparently increased based
on a positive change in the number of turtles observed during nightly
tally counts (Limpus et al. 2003). For example, mean nesting levels
increased from 2,361 females/night during 1974-1979 to 3,680
females/night during 1995-2000. However, since the mid 1990s there
has been a leveling off of the rate of increase (Chaloupka et al. in
review) and there are concerns about the long-term health of this nesting
population (Limpus et al. 2003). First, there have been recent
recruitment failures due to flooding of nests by rising ground waters,
                       21

which threaten the long-term viability of this rookery (Limpus et al.
2003). Second, although green turtles still nest in large numbers, there
has been a progressive decrease in the mean nesting size of females
(Limpus et al. 2003). Although this decrease is only a few centimeters
or less, it may be a response to a reduction in the proportion of older
turtles to the population (probably due to mortality in Southeast Asia)
(Limpus et al. 2002) and a warning that the Raine Island nesting
population may be in the early stages of decline. Another trend
indicative of decline is that in recent years there has been an increase in
the mean remigration interval of turtles nesting at Raine Island (Limpus
et al. 2002). Given that the remigration interval of females returning for
only their second season is longer than that for turtles that have nested
during multiple prior seasons (i.e., older turtles), the observed increase
in mean remigration interval further supports the notion that fewer large
turtles are present in the population (Limpus et al. 2002). However, that
these trends could also be interpreted as good signs indicating a
preponderance of new recruits to the population, or a decrease in forage
quality at the foraging sites for Raine Island nesters.
Despite the status of Raine Island as the largest nesting concentration
worldwide, there are still no reliable estimates of mean annual female
abundance. This is largely because no surveys have been done over the
course of the entire nesting season, and also a result of the sheer
numbers of turtles that may nest on any given night, which makes
accurate counting very difficult. However, based on a quasi mark-
recapture study in which females were painted during nightly tally
counts followed by the counting of marked and unmarked turtles in
internesting habitats, Limpus et al. (2003) stated that "…for mean tally
counts of 4,000 females per walk of the beach… there is an estimated
internesting population adjacent to the Raine Island Rookery of
approximately 25,000 breeding female C. mydas." This value, although
a rough estimate, suggests that during some years, Raine Island may not
be the largest nesting colony in the world as widely believed. However,
in particularly dense years upwards of 80,000 females can be present in
the internesting habitat (Limpus et al. 2003).
At Guam, nesting was stable from 1990-2001 with the annual number of
nesting females fluctuating between 2 and 60 females (Cummings
2002). This trend also appears to be ongoing in the marine environment,
where aerial surveys during 1994-2002 show a fairly constant near shore
abundance of 150-250 turtles (Cummings 2002).
The Ogasawara nesting population (Chichi-jima Island) is one of the
major green turtle nesting concentrations in Japan and has the longest
continuous record of harvest for anywhere in the world (Horikoshi et al.
1994). Relative to the late 1800s/early 1900s, there has been a
substantial decline in annual harvest rates for green turtles in this region,
which is suggestive of a long-term decline in the population. However,
since nesting abundance data were first collected in the late 1970s, there
                        22

has been an increase in the annual nesting abundance. The population
has increased from a mean of approximately 100 females/year in the late
1970s/early 1980s to a mean of approximately 500 per year since 2000.
Chaloupka et al. (in review) reports an estimated annual population
growth rate of 6.8% per year for the Chichi-jima rookery.
Central Pacific
The green turtle nesting concentration at East Island in the French
Frigate Shoals (Hawaii, USA) is the largest in the Central Pacific. Since
the initial nesting surveys in 1973, there has been a marked increase in
annual green turtle nesting at East Island (Balazs and Chaloupka 2004a,
2006). During the first 5 years of monitoring (1973-1977), the mean
annual nesting abundance was 83 females, and during the most recent 5
years of monitoring (2002-2006), the mean annual nesting abundance
was 400 females (Balazs and Chaloupka 2006; G. Balazs, NMFS,
unpublished data). This increase over the last 30+ years corresponds to
an underlying near-linear increase of about 5.7% per year (Balazs and
Chaloupka 2006).
Information on in-water abundance trends is consistent with the increase
in nesting (Balazs 1996, 2000; Balazs et al. 2005). This linkage is to be
expected since, based on genetics, satellite telemetry, and direct
observation, green turtles from the nesting beaches in the French Frigate
Shoals rookery remain resident to foraging pastures throughout the
archipelago (with the possible exception of the oceanic juvenile phase -
for which there are no available data and which genetic sampling has yet
to reveal) and are the exclusive nesting population present in these areas
(Balazs 1976, 1994; Bennett et al. 2002; Dutton and Balazs in review).
A significant increase in catch per unit effort of green turtles was seen
from 1982-1999 during bull-pen fishing conducted at Palaau, Molokai
(Balazs 2000). The number of immature green turtles residing in
foraging areas of the eight main Hawaiian Islands has increased (Balazs
1996). In addition, although the causes are not totally clear, there has
been a dramatic increase in the number of basking turtles in the
Hawaiian Islands over the last two decades, both in the southern
foraging areas of the main islands (Balazs 1996) as well as at northern
foraging areas at Midway Atoll (Balazs et al. 2005). Although it is not
possible to unequivocally tie this increase in basking to an increase in in-
water abundance, it nonetheless provides a compelling example of
abundance change for the Hawaiian green turtle population.
Eastern Pacific
Green turtles in the eastern Pacific Ocean have been considered among
the most depleted of green turtle populations worldwide. However,
recent evidence suggests that may not be the case. This section will
discuss the situation for green turtles in the Galapagos and along the
Pacific coast of Central America. For a discussion of current population
                        23

trends of green turtles in Michoacan and the Revillagigedos Islands, see
Subsection C on the Endangered Pacific Mexico Breeding Population.
In the Galapagos Islands (Ecuador), nesting at the four primary nesting
sites (Quinta Playa and Barahona - Isabela Island, Las Bachas - Santa
Cruz Island, and Las Salinas - Baltras Island) has been stable to slightly
increasing since the late 1970s. Mean annual nesting abundance at these
sites was 1,283 females from 1979-1980 to 1982-1983 (Green and Ortiz-
Crespo 1982; M. Hurtado, unpublished data). From 2001-2002 to 2005-
2006, a mean of 1,648 females nested each year (Zárate et al. 2006).
Based on these data, it is apparent that the Galapagos nesting
concentration is currently the largest for green turtles in the eastern
Pacific Ocean, followed by Michoacan, which has had a mean of 1,395
nesters per year since 2000 (C. Delgado-Trejo, Universidad Michoacana,
personal communication, 2006). Historically, however, with upwards of
25,000 females per year, the Michoacan site was the largest (Cliffton et
al. 1982).
Green turtles nest sporadically along much of the Pacific coast of
Central America, and although long-term trends are available for only
one site, it is clear that a substantial number of green turtles nest along
this coast each year. At Playa Naranjo (Costa Rica), 326 confirmed
green turtle nests were laid during the 1971-1972 nesting season,
compared to 102 nests in 1996-1997, 11 nests in 1998-1999 (Behm et al.
2002), and about 200 nesting emergences in 2006-2007 (A. Gaos,
PRETOMA, Costa Rica, unpublished data). Additional sites in Costa
Rica include Caña Blanca, where 50-100 nests/year were reported from
1998-2000, and Punta Banco, where 73-233 nests were deposited
annually from 1996-2001 (López and Arauz 2003). Green turtles have
also been reported to nest at El Hawaii, Guatemala, where
approximately 20 nests were deposited per night in the late 1970s
(Cornelius 1982), and at Jiquilisco, El Salvador (Marquez 1990).
A.2.3.1.2.2. Demography
The primary demographic features of green turtles that are relevant for
interpreting population abundance and long term trends include age-to-
maturity (often via growth studies), reproductive longevity, reproductive
output (i.e., egg production, clutch frequency, internesting interval), and
annual survivorship. A brief description of these features is given
below.
Most green turtles exhibit particularly slow growth rates, which has been
described as a consequence of their largely herbivorous (i.e., low net
energy) diet (Bjorndal 1982). Growth rates of juveniles vary
substantially among populations, ranging from <1 cm/year (Green 1993)
to >5 cm/year (McDonald-Dutton and Dutton 1998), likely due to
differences in diet quality, duration of foraging season (Chaloupka et al.
2004b), and density of turtles in foraging areas (Bjorndal et al. 2000,
                          24

Seminoff et al. 2002c, Balazs and Chaloupka 2004b). In general, there
is a tendency for green turtles to exhibit monotonic growth (declining
growth rate with size) in the Atlantic and non-monotonic growth
(growth spurt in mid size classes) in the Pacific, although this is not
always the case (Chaloupka and Musick 1997, Seminoff et al. 2002c,
Balazs and Chaloupka 2004b).
Consistent with slow growth, age-to-maturity for the green turtles
appears to be the longest of any sea turtle species (Chaloupka and
Musick 1997, Hirth 1997). Estimates based on skeletochronology and
mark recapture studies indicate that age-to-maturity ranges from perhaps
less than 20 years to 40 years or more (Limpus and Chaloupka 1997,
Zug and Glor 1998, Seminoff et al. 2002c, Zug et al. 2002, Chaloupka et
al. 2004b).
Estimates of reproductive longevity range from 17-23 years (Carr et al.
1978, Fitzsimmons et al. 1995, Chaloupka et al. 2004b). Considering
that mean remigration intervals range from 2 to 5 years (see Hirth 1997
for review), these reproductive longevity estimates suggest that a female
may nest 3 to 11 seasons over the course of her life. Based on the
reasonable means of 3 nests/season and 100 eggs/nest (Hirth 1997), a
female may deposit 9 to 33 clutches, or about 900-3,300 eggs, during her
lifetime. These are very approximate estimates, but they nonetheless
provide a basis for characterizing reproductive effort in green turtles.
Survivorship has been quantified for green turtles resident to foraging
areas as well as for adult females at nesting beaches. In general,
survivorship tends to be lower for juveniles and subadults than for
adults. In the southern Great Barrier Reef, Chaloupka and Limpus
(2005) provided estimates for mean annual adult survival (0.95) that was
significantly higher than survival for either subadults or juveniles (0.85
and 0.88, respectively). Seminoff et al. (2003) reported mean annual
survival of adults and juveniles as 0.97 and 0.58, respectively, in the
Gulf of California. At a Bahamas foraging habitat, juvenile green turtle
survivorship was considerably higher at 0.89, although this value
dropped to 0.76 once turtles emigrated from this protected site (Bjorndal
et al. 2003). Low survivorship as a result of human impacts has also
been reported for a Caribbean Nicaraguan foraging area where Campbell
and Lagueux (2005) found low survival (0.55) among large juveniles
and adults; they also report annual survival of adults nesting at
Tortuguero of 0.82, which is close to the value of 0.85 reported by
Troëng and Chaloupka (2007) for the same rookery. Therefore, it is
apparent that the survivorship at any particular site will be influenced by
the level of human impacts, with the more pristine green turtle stocks
tending to represent more 'natural' survivorship values (e.g., Great
Barrier Reef) and others with survivorship values largely influenced by
anthropogenic impacts (e.g., Nicaragua).
                       25

          A.2.3.1.2.3. Demographic trends
          One aspect relating to green turtle demography that seems to be a
          growing problem is the increasing female bias in the sex ratio of green
          turtle hatchlings, likely related to two primary factors: global climate
          change and imperfect egg hatchery strategies (Tiwol and Cabanban
          2000, Hays et al. 2003, Baker et al. 2006). Global warming is
          unequivocal (IPCC 2007a) and may result in significant changes in
          hatchling sex ratios. The fact that green turtles exhibit temperature-
          dependent sex determination (Mrosovsky 1994) suggests that there may
          be a skewing of future green turtle cohorts toward strong female bias
          (because warmer temperatures produce more female embryos). At least
          one site - Ascension Island - has had an increase of mean sand
          temperature in recent years (Hays et al. 2003). A similar, although more
          localized, problem is that of high incubation temperatures in poorly
          located egg hatcheries of nesting beach conservation programs. For
          example, artificially high incubation temperatures are resulting in nearly
          100% female sex among hatchlings at the Sabah Turtle Island hatcheries
          (Tiwol and Cabanban 2000).
A.2.3.1.3 Genetics and genetic variation:
          The genetic substructure of the green turtle regional subpopulations
          shows distinctive mitochondrial DNA properties for each nesting
          rookery (Bowen et al. 1992, FitzSimmons et al. 2006). Mitochondrial
          DNA data suggest that the global matriarchal phylogeny of green turtles
          has been shaped by ocean basin separations (Bowen et al. 1992,
          Encalada et al. 1996) and by natal homing behavior (Meylan et al.
          1990). Studies examining microsatellites (nuclear DNA) confirm that,
          like females, male turtles demonstrate regional philopatry (FitzSimmons
          et al. 1997a), although male-mediated gene flow among populations has
          also been reported, and may act as a mechanism for the genetic
          exchange that occurs among beaches (Roberts et al. 2004, FitzSimmons
          et al. 1997b). However, comparatively few data are available on male
          green turtle demography, and the strength of male philopatry to nesting
          beaches. The importance of male mediated gene flow is also unknown
          for the vast majority of nesting sites.
          The fact that sea turtles exhibit fidelity to their natal beaches suggests
          that if populations become extirpated they may not be replenished by the
          recruitment of turtles from other nesting rookeries over ecological time
          frames. Moreover, because each nesting population is genetically
          discrete, the loss of even one rookery represents a decline in genetic
          diversity and resilience of the species (Bowen 1995). If, however, an
          exploited population is able to withstand total extirpation, genetic
          diversity may not be appreciably reduced (Encalada 1994, Chassin-
          Norria et al. 2004). Therefore, it can be argued that any population, no
          matter how small, will continue to contribute to the overall genetic
          diversity of green turtles. While this is correct at a genetic level, it is
                                  26

          important to note that the probabilities of and opportunities for depleted
          populations contributing to a geographically-wider gene pool will be
          reduced.
          Over the last decade, there have been substantial efforts to determine the
          nesting population origins of green turtles assembled in foraging
          grounds. Genetic research has shown that green turtles from multiple
          nesting beach origins commonly mix in these areas (Bass et al. 1998,
          2006; Lahanas et al. 1998; Bass and Witzell 2000; D'Aloia and Al Ghais
          2000; Formia 2002; Nichols 2003a; Luke et al. 2004; Dethmers et al.
          2006; Naro-Maciel et al. 2007; Bolker et al. 2007; P. Dutton, NMFS,
          unpublished data). However, such mixing occurs at extremely low
          levels in Hawaiian foraging areas and this central Pacific population
          stands out as perhaps the most isolated of all green turtle populations
          worldwide (Dutton and Balazs in review). There is one main
          mitochondrial DNA haplotype with no difference in mitochondrial DNA
          haplotype frequencies between foraging ground populations and females
          nesting at the East Island rookery (LeRoux et al. 2003, Dutton and
          Balazs in review). Although green turtles from the east Pacific
          population have been rarely recorded in Hawaiian waters (LeRoux et al.
          2003, Dutton and Balazs in review), the low frequency of these
          occurrences suggests that they are not ecologically significant.
A.2.3.1.4 Taxonomic classification:
          The taxonomic classification for the green turtle has not changed since
          the species was listed. It remains as follows:
          Kingdom: Animalia
          Phylum: Chordata
          Class: Reptilia
          Order: Testudines
          Family: Cheloniidae
          Genus: Chelonia
          Species: mydas
          Common name: Green sea turtle
A.2.3.1.5 Spatial distribution and change in distribution within the historic
          range:
          A.2.3.1.5.1. Spatial distribution
          The green turtle has a circumglobal distribution, occurring throughout
          tropical, subtropical waters, and, to a lesser extent, temperate waters.
          Their movements within the marine environment are not fully
          understood, but it is believed that green turtles inhabit coastal waters of
          over 140 countries (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989).
                                  27

Nesting occurs in more than 80 countries worldwide (Hirth 1997). The
primary nesting rookeries (i.e., sites with ≥ 500 nesting females per
year) are located at Ascension Island, Australia, Brazil (Trindade
Island), Comoros Islands, Costa Rica (Tortuguero), Ecuador (Galapagos
Archipelago), Guinea-Bissau (Bijagos Archipelago), Eparces Islands,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Oman, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles
Islands, Suriname, and United States (Hawaii) (see Subsection A.2.3.1.2
and Seminoff 2004 for citations). Lesser nesting areas are located in
Agalega, Angola, Aru Islands, Bangladesh, Bikar Atoll, Brazil (Atoll da
Rocas), Chagos Archipelago, China, Costa Rica (Pacific coast), Cuba,
Cyprus, Democratic Republic of Yemen, Dominican Republic,
d'Entrecasteaux Reef, Equatorial Guinea (Bioko Island), French Guiana,
French West Indies, Ghana, Gulf of Carpentaria coast of Australia,
Guyana, India, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Madagascar, Maldives Islands,
Mayotte Archipelago, Mexico (Yucatan Peninsula, Revillagigedos
Islands), Micronesia, Myanmar, Natuna Islands, New Caledonia,
Nicaragua, Pakistan, Palmerston Atoll, Papua New Guinea, Primieras
Islands, Sao Tome é Principe, Scilly Atoll, Sierra Leone, Solomon
Islands, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey,
Venezuela, and Vietnam (for a complete listing of country citations see
Seminoff 2004). Sporadic nesting occurs in at least 30 additional
countries (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989).
A.2.3.1.5.2. Change in distribution of the species within its historic
               range
The present distribution of the breeding sites has been largely affected
by historical patterns of human exploitation. Most of the substantial
breeding colonies left today are those that have not been permanently
inhabited by humans or have not been heavily exploited until recently
(Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989, Seminoff 2004). Although not the
case for all rookeries, this demographic trend is corroborated by the fact
that several islands that formerly held large breeding colonies are known
to have lost them once becoming inhabited by humans (e.g., Bermuda,
King 1982; Mauritius, Hughes 1982; Reunion, Bertrand et al. 1986;
Cape Verde Islands, Parsons 1962). In addition, the Cayman Island
rookery, formerly one of the largest green turtle rookeries in the world,
was nearly if not totally extirpated after human colonization and the
onset of an organized turtle fishery at these islands (Parsons 1962).
Although green turtles continue to nest at extremely low levels at the
Cayman Islands (Aiken et al. 2001), it is unknown whether they are a
relict nesting subpopulation or the result of recolonization by turtles
from adjacent nesting rookeries in the western Atlantic or headstarted
turtles from the Cayman Turtle Farm (Wood and Wood 1993).
                        28

A.2.3.1.6 Habitat or ecosystem conditions:
          Green turtles spend the majority of their lives in coastal foraging
          grounds. These areas include both open coastline and protected bays
          and lagoons. While in these areas, green turtles rely on marine algae and
          seagrass as their primary diet constituents, although some populations
          also forage heavily on invertebrates. These marine habitats are often
          highly dynamic and in areas with annual fluctuation in seawater and air
          temperatures, which can cause the distribution and abundance of
          potential green turtle food items to vary substantially between seasons
          and years (Carballo et al. 2002). Many prey species that are abundant
          during winter and spring periods become patchy during warm summer
          periods. Some species may altogether vanish during extreme
          temperatures, such as those that occur during El Niño Southern
          Oscillation events (Carballo et al. 2002).
          Conditions at coastal foraging areas have been shown to impact the
          timing of green turtle reproduction (Limpus and Nicholls 1987, Solow et
          al. 2002). Therefore, despite the fact that foraging areas are usually
          separated from nesting areas by hundreds to thousands of kilometers,
          they have a profound influence on population dynamics of green turtles.
          Annual and decadal oscillations likely play a large role; however, a
          better understanding is needed concerning how environmental variability
          triggers or limits green turtle migration and reproduction. In addition,
          red tide episodes at foraging areas may lead to mortality of juvenile and
          adult green turtles, thereby impacting a population's present and future
          reproductive status (Redlow et al. 2002; J. Seminoff, NMFS, personal
          observation; L. Sarti, CONANP, personal communication, 2007).
          In addition to coastal foraging areas, oceanic habitats are used by
          oceanic-stage juveniles, migrating adults, and, on some occasions, by
          green turtles that reside in the oceanic zone for foraging. Despite these
          uses of the oceanic zone by green turtles, much remains to be learned
          about how oceanography affects juvenile survival, adult migration, and
          prey availability.
          At nesting beaches, green turtles rely on safe and healthy beaches with
          intact dune structures, native vegetation, and normal beach temperatures
          for nesting (Ackerman 1997). Coastal areas denuded of vegetation or
          with coastal construction can impact thermal regimes on beaches and
          thus affect the incubation and resulting sex ratio of hatchling turtles.
          Further, climate change may impact these beaches through sea level rise
          (Baker et al. 2006, IPCC 2007a) and eventually, lethal incubation
          temperatures on nesting beaches (Glen and Mrosovsky 2004).
                                  29

A.2.3.2 Five-Factor Analysis (threats, conservation measures, and regulatory
        mechanisms)
        The determination to list a species under the ESA is based on the best scientific and
        commercial data regarding five listing factors (see below). Subsequent 5-year
        reviews must also make determinations about the listing status based, in part, on
        these same factors.
        A.2.3.2.1 Present or threatened destruction, modification or curtailment of its
                   habitat or range:
                   There are increasing impacts to the nesting and marine environment that
                   affect green turtles. Structural impacts to nesting habitat include the
                   construction of buildings and pilings, beach armoring and
                   renourishment, and sand extraction (Lutcavage et al. 1997, Bouchard et
                   al. 1998). These factors may directly, through loss of beach habitat, or
                   indirectly, through changing thermal profiles and increasing erosion,
                   serve to decrease the amount of nesting area available to nesting
                   females, and may evoke a change in the natural behaviors of adults and
                   hatchlings (Ackerman 1997; Witherington et al. 2003, 2007). In
                   addition, coastal development is usually accompanied by artificial
                   lighting. The presence of lights on or adjacent to nesting beaches alters
                   the behavior of nesting adults (Witherington 1992) and is often fatal to
                   emerging hatchlings as they are attracted to light sources and drawn
                   away from the water (Witherington and Bjorndal 1991). In many
                   countries, coastal development and artificial lighting are responsible for
                   substantial hatchling mortality. Although legislation controlling these
                   impacts does exist (Lutcavage et al. 1997), a majority of countries do
                   not have regulations in place.
                   Considering that coastal development and beach armoring is detrimental
                   to green turtle nesting behavior (Lutcavage et al. 1997), the pending
                   human population expansion is reason for major concern. This concern
                   is underscored by the fact that over the next few decades the human
                   population is expected to grow by more than 3 billion people (about
                   50%). By the year 2025, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
                   Cultural Organization (UNESCO) (2001) forecasts that population
                   growth and migration will result in a situation in which 75% of the
                   world human population will live within 60 km of the sea. Such a
                   migration undoubtedly will change a coastal landscape that, in many
                   areas, is already suffering from human impacts. The problems
                   associated with development in these zones will progressively become a
                   greater challenge for conservation efforts, particularly in the developing
                   world where wildlife conservation is often secondary to other national
                   needs.
                   In addition to impacting the terrestrial zone, anthropogenic disturbances
                   also threaten coastal marine habitats, particularly areas rich in seagrass
                   and marine algae. These impacts include contamination from
                                           30

          herbicides, pesticides, oil spills, and other chemicals, as well as
          structural degradation from excessive boat anchoring and dredging
          (Francour et al. 1999, Lee Long et al. 2000, Waycott et al. 2005).
          Overall, seagrass habitats are perhaps the most susceptible of all coastal
          marine habitats since the areas where they occur (sheltered coast with
          good water quality) are often targets for port development, and
          commonly are at the downstream end of drainages from human
          settlements (Waycott et al. 2005). Compounding the problem is that
          these habitats show low resiliency to human disturbance, and once
          damaged, often take years if not decades to fully regenerate (Francour et
          al. 1999). Further, the introduction of alien algae species threatens the
          stability of some coastal ecosystems and may lead to the elimination of
          preferred dietary species of green turtles (De Wreede 1996). Although
          some alien algae species are consumed by green turtles (Russell and
          Balazs 1994), others may prove toxic to green turtles, or at the very
          least, their promulgation may negatively impact the availability of native
          green turtle benthic foods (i.e., on the sea floor).
          The vast depletion of green turtles in coastal foraging areas has likely
          resulted in widespread habitat modifications as a result of the associated
          loss of ecological function, which has negative implications for the
          maintenance of both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. As large
          herbivores, green turtles impact seagrass productivity and abundance
          (Bjorndal 1982, Zieman et al. 1984) and continue to represent an
          essential trophic pathway over expansive coastal marine habitats
          (Thayer et al. 1982, 1984; Valentine and Heck 1999). Through egg
          deposition on beaches, sea turtles act as biological transporters of
          nutrients and energy from marine to terrestrial ecosystems (Bouchard
          and Bjorndal 2000). Thus, with most green turtle populations
          substantially depleted relative to historic levels, it is likely that today's
          coastal marine and terrestrial systems are dramatically modified
          (Jackson 1997, Jackson et al. 2001). The fact that the total adult green
          turtle population for the entire pre-Columbian Caribbean population
          ranged from somewhere between 16 to 660 million turtles (combined
          estimates from Jackson 1997, Bjorndal et al. 2000) and were regulated
          by the availability of turtlegrass (Thalassia testudinum) underscores just
          how much the current green turtle population, and coastal habitat, has
          changed.
A.2.3.2.2 Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or
          educational purposes:
          Green turtles, like all sea turtle species, are vulnerable to anthropogenic
          impacts during all life-stages: from eggs to adults. Three of the greatest
          threats to green turtles result from intentional killing for commercial and
          subsistence use. These include take of eggs, killing of females on
          nesting beaches, and directed hunting of green turtles in foraging areas.
          Fisheries bycatch is also a major issue, and is described in a later
          section.
                                  31

Take of Eggs
One of the most detrimental human threats to green turtles is the
intentional take of eggs from nesting beaches. As each nesting season
passes and populations continue to suffer from egg removal, they will
progressively lose the juvenile cohorts that would have recruited from
the post-hatchling phase (Mortimer 1995). Present nesting populations
may appear hardy, but without recruitment into the juvenile population
and a well-balanced distribution of turtles among all cohorts,
populations are more vulnerable to decline (Crouse et al. 1987, Frazer
1992).
Egg removal has impacted green turtle populations throughout the
world. It is an ongoing major problem in Comoros Island, Costa Rica,
Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, India, Indonesia, Ivory
Coast, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Panama, Philippines, Sao Tome é
Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam
(summarized in Seminoff 2004).
Killing of Nesting Females
Killing of nesting females continues to threaten the stability of green
turtle subpopulations in many areas. These losses affect nesting
populations both by reducing adult abundance and through reducing the
population's potential for annual egg production. Areas with ongoing
intentional killing of nesting adults include Australia, Bioko Island,
Costa Rica, Guinea-Bissau, India, Japan, Mexico, Seychelles, and
Yemen (Seminoff 2004). For example, from 1997 to 1999 a mean of
9.8% of nests near the township of Tortuguero, Costa Rica, were
poached (S. Troëng, The Ocean Conservancy, personal communication,
2002) and, over the entire nesting beach, a mean of 600 adults were
killed annually with a peak of 1,720 nesting adults poached in 1997
(Troëng 1998, Troëng and Rankin González 2000). Although there are
likely more countries where such intentional take continues, it is
apparent that, based on the preceding list, the killing of nesting females
remains a problem in many areas throughout the world.
Hunting of Turtles in Foraging Habitats
The large-scale in-water movements of green turtles often cross
jurisdictional boundaries and traverse areas where protection is absent.
While adult mortality results in more quickly observable changes at the
nesting beach, it is the mortality of immature turtles in marine habitats
that may be a greater threat to the stability of green turtle populations.
This life-stage is the most valuable in terms of recovery and stabilization
of sea turtle populations due to the fact that not only have large juveniles
already survived many mortality factors thus having a high reproductive
value, but also there are typically more juveniles than adults in a
                        32

population (Crouse et al. 1987, Ogren 1989). Therefore, relatively small
changes in the survival rate of this life-stage class impact a large
segment of the population (Crouse 1999). As with the delayed feedback
from egg harvest, green turtles' slow maturation delays the observable
effects of juvenile harvests, and they may not manifest as a decline in
nesting females for decades. However, once there is a crash in the adult
nesting population as a result of such impacts, the nesting population
may be substantially more difficult to recover compared to a population
with a thriving sub-adult population (Mortimer 1991).
Areas of particularly heavy exploitation of green turtles include the
Caribbean Sea, Southeast Asia, Eastern Pacific, and Western Indian
Ocean. Along the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, approximately 11,000
adult and juvenile green turtles were killed annually in the 1990s;
according to preliminary analyses, current exploitation levels appear to
have decreased. At the Miskito Cays along the Caribbean coast of
Nicaragua, an area considered to be the primary foraging habitat for
turtles originating from Tortuguero, a mean of 9,357 turtles were killed
per year from 1994-1996 (Lagueux 1998). This large-scale directed
fishery continues today, although the autonomous regional governments
and the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA)
are initiating discussions that may lead to a lessening of the take (C.
Lagueux, Wildlife Conservation Society, personal communication,
2007). In Southeast Asia, tens of thousands, perhaps more than 100,000
juvenile and adult green turtles, were hunted annually as recently as the
late 1990s (Limpus et al. 2002). In the eastern Pacific, up to 10,000
green turtles were harvested annually as recently as 2001 (Nichols et al.
2002). Directed hunting continues to be a problem in this region,
although there are signs that this has started to decline (Seminoff et al.
2003). In the western Indian Ocean, one of the areas of greatest concern
is in Madagascar. First reported in the 1990s (Rakotonirina and Cooke
1994, Mbindo 1996), this fishery currently lands thousands of green
turtles each year (A. Cooke, Marine and Coastal Environment
Programme, National Environment Office, Madagascar, personal
communication to J. Mortimer, Seychelles Island Conservation Society,
2001). When combined with incidental captures, green turtle mortality
in the Madagascar region is believed to be at least 10,000 individuals
each year (J. Mortimer, Seychelles Island Conservation Society,
personal communication, 2001). A similar situation has been described
in Oman, where, in 1990 for example, a combined 4,280 green turtles
were taken through direct harvest and incidental capture in demersal
trawl fisheries (Hare 1991).
Intentional capture of green turtles also occurs in many other countries,
including Australia, Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, Cameroon,
Cayman Islands, Comoros Islands, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, Equatorial
Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, India, Indonesia, Ivory
Coast, Liberia, Mayotte Archipelago, New Caledonia, Pakistan, Papua
New Guinea, Sao Tome é Principe, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Solomon
                        33

          Islands, Togo, Turks and Caicos, Vanuatu, and Vietnam (Seminoff
          2004). Despite substantial declines in green turtle subpopulation size,
          intentional killing remains legal in several of these countries (Humphrey
          and Salm 1996, Fleming 2001, Fretey 2001).
A.2.3.2.3 Disease or predation:
          Diseases threaten a large number of existing subpopulations. The most
          commonly identified disease in green turtles is fibropapillomatosis (FP).
          This disease is characterized by the presence of internal and/or external
          tumors (fibropapillomas) that may grow large enough to hamper
          swimming, vision, feeding, and potential escape from predators (Herbst
          1994). Fibropapillomas have been reported in all sea turtle species. For
          unknown reasons, the frequency of FP is much higher in green turtles
          than in other species.
          Although FP has been the subject of extensive research, the particular
          cause of this condition remains unknown. Outbreaks of the disease may
          be linked to a predominant viral variant that is endemic in that habitat
          (Ene et al. 2005), and there is speculation that the prevalence of this
          disease has reached epidemic proportions due to immunosuppression in
          green turtles brought about by human-related habitat degradation
          (George 1997). However, immunosuppression may not be a prerequisite
          for development of FP in all cases (Work et al. 2001). Other potential
          causes that have received attention include the ingestion of toxic algae
          such as Prorocentrum spp. (Holloway-Adkins 2001, Anderson 2002)
          and Lyngbya majuscula (Arthur et al. 2006). The widespread incidence
          of FP should be taken into consideration when determining the ESA
          listing status of green turtles.
          The population-level impacts of this disease to green turtles are not yet
          understood. Extremely high incidence has been reported in Florida,
          where the affliction rate reaches 62% in some areas (Schroeder et al.
          1998), and Hawaii, where affliction rates peaked at 47% to 69% in some
          foraging areas (Murakawa et al. 2000). The fact that 22% of the 6,027
          green turtles stranded in Florida from 1980-2005 had external FP tumors
          suggests serious consequences for population stability (FFWCC 2007,
          Singel et al. 2003). However, it should also be noted that photographic
          evidence from Hawaii and Florida shows that the tumors on some green
          turtles go into recession (Bennett et al. 2000, Hirama 2001) and in some
          cases the presence of FP may not hinder an individual's growth
          (Chaloupka and Balazs 2005). The implications of these studies are still
          not fully understood, although it is indicative that FP is not always
          lethal. To better explain the physical impact of tumor presence,
          additional comprehensive studies are needed (Work et al. 2004).
          This disease has also been reported for green turtle subpopulations of
          Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Cameroon,
          Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Federated States
                                  34

          of Micronesia, Gabon, Gambia, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Mexico,
          Nicaragua, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Sao Tome and Senegal, Seychelles,
          U.S. Virgin Islands, and Venezuela (summarized in Seminoff 2004).
A.2.3.2.4 Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms:
          The conservation and recovery of sea turtles, and green turtles
          particularly, is facilitated by a number of regulatory instruments at
          international, regional, national, and local levels. As a result of these
          designations and agreements, many of the intentional impacts directed at
          sea turtles have been lessened: harvest of eggs and adults has been
          slowed at several nesting areas through nesting beach conservation
          efforts and an increasing number of community-based initiatives are in
          place to slow the take of turtles in foraging areas. Moreover, there is
          now an increased international effort to reduce sea turtle interactions and
          mortality in artisanal and industrial fishing practices.
          Despite these advances, human impacts continue throughout the world.
          The lack of comprehensive and effective monitoring and bycatch
          reduction efforts in many pelagic and near-shore fisheries operations still
          allows substantial direct and indirect mortality, and the uncontrolled
          development of coastal and marine habitats threatens to destroy the
          supporting ecosystems of long-lived green turtles. Although several
          international agreements provide legal protection for sea turtles,
          additional multi-lateral efforts are needed to ensure they are sufficiently
          implemented and/or strengthened, and key non-signatory parties need to
          be encouraged to accede.
          Considering the worldwide distribution of green turtles, virtually every
          legal instrument that targets or impacts sea turtles is almost certain to
          cover green turtles. A summary of the main regulatory instruments from
          throughout the world that relate to green turtle management is provided
          below. The pros and cons of many of these were recently evaluated by
          Hykle (2002) and Tiwari (2002), and a summary of these findings is
          given when appropriate.
          United States Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and
          Management Act
          The recently-amended U.S. Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation
          and Management Act (MSA), implemented by NMFS, mandates
          environmentally responsible fishing practices within U.S. fisheries.
          Section 301 of the MSA establishes National Standards to be addressed
          in management plans. Any regulations promulgated to implement such
          plans, including conservation and management measures, shall, to the
          extent practicable, (A) minimize bycatch and (B) to the extent bycatch
          cannot be avoided, minimize the mortality of such bycatch. Section 301
          by itself does not require specific measures. However, mandatory
          bycatch reduction measures can be incorporated into management plans
                                   35

for specific fisheries, as has happened with the U.S. pelagic longline
fisheries in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Section 316 requires the
establishment of a bycatch reduction engineering program to develop
"technological devices and other conservation engineering changes
designed to minimize bycatch, seabird interactions, bycatch mortality,
and post-release mortality in Federally managed fisheries."
FAO Technical Consultation on Sea Turtle-Fishery Interactions
While not a true international instrument for conservation, the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' (FAO) technical
consultation on sea turtle-fishery interactions was groundbreaking in that
it solidified the commitment of this international body to reduce sea
turtle bycatch in marine fisheries operations. Recommendations from
the technical consultation were endorsed by the FAO Committee on
Fisheries (COFI) and called for the immediate implementation by
member nations and Regional Fishery Management Organizations
(RFMOs) of guidelines to reduce sea turtle mortality in fishing
operations, developed as part of the technical consultation. Compliance
with these guidelines is voluntary.
Indian Ocean – South-East Asian Marine Turtle Memorandum of
Understanding (IOSEA)
This MOU puts in place a framework through which States of the Indian
Ocean and South-East Asian region, as well as other concerned States,
can work together to conserve and replenish depleted marine turtle
populations for which they share responsibility. This collaboration is
achieved through the collective implementation of an associated
Conservation and Management Plan. Currently, there are 26 signatory
states. The United States became a signatory in 2001. Numerous
accomplishments have been made under the auspices of this MOU (for
detailed information, visit the IOSEA website at
http://www.ioseaturtles.org).
Memorandum of Understanding on ASEAN Sea Turtle Conservation and
Protection
The objectives of this MOU, initiated by the Association of South East
Asian Nations (ASEAN), are to promote the protection, conservation,
replenishing, and recovery of sea turtles and their habitats based on the
best available scientific evidence, taking into account the environmental,
socio-economic and cultural characteristics of the Parties. It currently
has nine signatory states in the South East Asian Region. Additional
information is available at http://www.aseansec.org/6185.htm.
Memorandum of Agreement between the Government of the Republic of
the Philippines and the Government of Malaysia on the Establishment of
the Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area
                        36

Signed in 1996, this bilateral MOA paved the way for the Turtle Islands
Heritage Protected Area (TIHPA), which protects one of the most
important green turtle nesting concentrations in the world and is also the
site of substantial foraging activity in coastal waters. Additional
information is available at
http://www.oneocean.org/ambassadors/track_a_turtle/tihpa/index.html.
Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Conservation Measures for
Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa.
This MOU was concluded under the auspices of the Convention on the
Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and became
effective in 1999. It aims at safeguarding six marine turtle species -
including the green turtle - that are estimated to have rapidly declined in
numbers during recent years due to excessive exploitation (both direct
and incidental) and the degradation of essential habitats. However,
despite this agreement, killing of adult turtles and harvesting of eggs
remains rampant in many areas along the Atlantic African coast.

Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea
Turtles (IAC)
This Convention is one of only a handful of international treaties
dedicated exclusively to sea turtles, setting standards for the
conservation of these endangered animals and their habitats with a large
emphasis on bycatch reduction. It is the only binding multi-national
agreement for sea turtles and is open to all countries in North, Central,
and South America, and the Caribbean. It currently has 12 signatory
countries, with the United States being a signatory in 1999. Additional
information is available at http://www.iacseaturtle.org.
Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals
This Convention, also known as the Bonn Convention or CMS, is an
international treaty that focuses on the conservation of migratory species
and their habitats. As of January 2007, the Convention had 101 member
states, including parties from Africa, Central and South America, Asia,
Europe, and Oceania. While the Convention has successfully brought
together about half the countries of the world with a direct interest in sea
turtles, it has yet to realize its full potential (Hykle 2002). Its
membership does not include a number of key countries, including
Brazil, Canada, China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Oman, and the United
States. Additional information is available at http://www.cms.int.
                         37

Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
The primary objectives of this international treaty are 1) the
conservation of biological diversity, 2) the sustainable use of its
components, and 3) the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising
out of the utilization of genetic resources. This Convention has been in
force since 1993 and currently has 190 Parties. While the Convention
provides a framework within which broad conservation objectives may
be pursued, it does not specifically address sea turtle conservation
(Hykle 2002). Additional information is available at http://www.cbd.int.
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES)
Known as CITES, this Convention was designed to regulate
international trade in a wide range of wild animals and plants. CITES
was implemented in 1975 and currently includes 169 Parties. Although
CITES has been effective at minimizing the international trade of sea
turtle products, it does not limit legal and illegal harvest within
countries, nor does it regulate intra-country commerce of sea turtle
products (Hykle 2002). Additional information is available at
http://www.cites.org.
Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity
in the Mediterranean
This Protocol is under the auspices of the Barcelona Convention for the
Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution. It has been in
force since 1999 and includes general provisions to protect sea turtles
and their habitats within the Mediterranean Sea. The Protocol requires
Parties to protect, preserve, and manage threatened or endangered
species, establish protected areas, and coordinate bilateral or multilateral
conservation efforts (Hykle 2002). In the framework of this Convention,
to which all Mediterranean countries are parties, the Action Plan for the
Conservation of Mediterranean Marine Turtles has been in effect since
1989. Additional information is available at http://www.rac-spa.org.
Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural
Habitats
Also known as the Bern Convention, the goals of this instrument are to
conserve wild flora and fauna and their natural habitats, especially those
species and habitats whose conservation requires the cooperation of
several States, and to promote such co-operation. The Convention was
enacted in 1982 and currently includes 45 European and African States
and the European Union. According to Hykle (2002), while the
Convention's "innovative approach to holding States to account for their
implementation of the Convention is laudable, and has certainly drawn
attention to issues of species and habitat protection, its efficacy in
                        38

relation to particular marine turtle cases that have been deliberated for
many years is debatable." Additional information is available at

environment/nature_and_biological_diversity/Nature_protection.
Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine
Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region
Also called the Cartagena Convention, this instrument has been in place
since 1986 and currently has 21 signatory states. Under this Convention,
the component that may relate to green turtles is the Protocol
Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) that has
been in place since 2000. The goals of this protocol are to encourage
Parties "to take all appropriate measures to protect and preserve rare or
fragile ecosystems, as well as the habitat of depleted, threatened or
endangered species, in the Convention area." All six sea turtle species in
the Wider Caribbean are listed in Annex II of the protocol, which
prohibits (a) the taking, possession or killing (including, to the extent
possible, the incidental taking, possession or killing) or commercial
trade in such species, their eggs, parts or products, and (b) to the extent
possible, the disturbance of such species, particularly during breeding,
incubation, estivation, migration, and other periods of biological stress.
Hykle (2002) believes that in view of the limited participation of
Caribbean States in the aforementioned Convention on the Conservation
of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, the provisions of the SPAW
Protocol provide the legal support for domestic conservation measures
that might otherwise not have been afforded. Additional information is
available at http://www.cep.unep.org/law/cartnut.html.
Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and
Environment of the South Pacific Region
This Convention has been in force since 1990 and currently includes 12
Parties. The purpose of the Convention is to protect the marine
environment and coastal zones of the South-East Pacific within the 200-
mile area of maritime sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Parties, and
beyond that area, the high seas up to a distance within which pollution of
the high seas may affect that area. Additional information is available at
http://ekh.unep.org/?q=node/684.
Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP)
SPREP is a regional organization based in Samoa established by the
governments and administrations of the Pacific region (21 Pacific island
member countries and four countries with direct interests in the region).
The goals of SPREP are to promote cooperation in the Pacific islands
region and to provide assistance to ensure sustainable development for
present and future generations. Sea turtles are among the focal animal
                        39

          groups within SPREP. Additional information is available at
          http://www.sprep.org.
A.2.3.2.5 Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence:
          There are several other manmade factors that affect green turtles in
          foraging areas and on nesting beaches. Two of these are truly global
          phenomena: climate change and fisheries bycatch.
          Impacts from climate change, especially due to global warming, are
          likely to become more apparent in future years (IPCC 2007a). The
          global mean temperature has risen 0.76ºC over the last 150 years, and
          the linear trend over the last 50 years is nearly twice that for the last 100
          years (IPCC 2007a). There is a high confidence, based on substantial
          new evidence, that observed changes in marine systems are associated
          with rising water temperatures, as well as related changes in ice cover,
          salinity, oxygen levels, and circulation. These changes include shifts in
          ranges and changes in algal, plankton, and fish abundance (IPCC
          2007b), which could affect primary food resources of green turtles.
          As global temperatures continue to increase, so will sand temperatures,
          which in turn will alter the thermal regime of incubating nests and alter
          natural sex ratios within hatchling cohorts (e.g., Glen and Mrosovsky
          2004). The effects of global warming are difficult to predict, but may be
          exacerbated on developed nesting beaches where shoreline armoring and
          construction has denuded natural vegetation. Sea level rise from global
          warming (IPCC 2007a) is also a potential problem , particularly for
          areas with low-lying beaches where sand depth is a limiting factor, as
          the sea may inundate nesting sites and decrease available nesting habitat
          (Daniels et al. 1993, Fish et al. 2005, Baker et al. 2006). The loss of
          habitat as a result of climate change could be accelerated due to a
          combination of other environmental and oceanographic changes such as
          increase in the frequency of storms and/or changes in prevailing
          currents, both of which could lead to increased beach loss via erosion
          (Antonelis et al. 2006, Baker et al. 2006).
          Fisheries bycatch in artisanal and industrial fishing gear is also a major
          impact. Although other species such as leatherback turtles and
          loggerhead turtles have received most of the attention relative to sea
          turtle bycatch, green turtles are also susceptible, particularly in nearshore
          artisanal fisheries gear. These fisheries practices include drift-netting,
          long-lining, set-netting, pound netting, and trawl fisheries, and their
          adverse impacts on sea turtles have been documented in marine
          environments throughout the world (National Research Council 1990,
          Lutcavage et al. 1997, Epperly 2003).
          In addition, there are numerous localized impacts to green turtles.
          Increasing incidence of exposure to heavy metals and other
          contaminants in the marine environment is of concern. Contaminants
                                  40

such as PCBs, mercury, copper, and other metals are present in tissues of
green turtles from numerous areas (Presti et al. 1999, Miao et al. 2001,
Al Rawahy et al. 2006, Lewis 2006). Although their explicit effects on
sea turtles have yet to be determined, such exposure may lead to
immunosuppression or other hormonal imbalances (J. Keller, National
Institute of Standards and Technology, personal communication, 2006).
Many of these agents also diminish the health of coastal marine
ecosystems, which may, in turn, adversely affect green turtles. The
interaction from oils spills is an episodic problem that can also impact
turtles worldwide (Yender and Mearns 2003), and this may lead to
immunosuppression and other chronic health issues (Sindermann et al.
1982).
Additional manmade factors affecting green turtles, albeit perhaps not as
globally impacting as those mentioned above, include impacts of boat
traffic on turtles and coastal habitats, ingestion and entanglement in
marine debris, and intake of turtles into cooling systems of coastal
powerplants. Boat strikes have been shown to be a major mortality
source in Florida (Singel et al. 2003), and it is quite likely that this is a
chronic, albeit unreported, problem near developed coastlines in other
areas as well (e.g., Oros et al. 2005). Boat traffice has been shown to
exclude green turtles from preferred coastal foraging pastures (Seminoff
et al. 2002a), which may negatively affect their nutritional intake. In
addition, the ingestion of and entanglement in marine debris can reduce
food intake and digestive capacity (Bjorndal et al. 1994, Sako and
Horikoshi 2002), and entanglement has been shown to cause mortality of
sea turtles (Bugoni et al. 2001). The impacts of marine debris continue
to be an emerging issue and, although data are lacking from open ocean
areas, it is quite likely that green turtles as well as other species are
substantially impacted in these regions (e.g., J. Seminoff, NMFS,
unpublished data). Along developed shores, intake into the cooling
systems of some coastal power plants has resulted in forced
submergence and mortality of sea turtles, particularly green and
loggerhead turtles (Florida Power and Light and Quantum Resources
Inc. 2005; Christina Fahy, NMFS, personal communication, 2007).
Finally, there is the issue of unregulated and illegal fisheries which
target green turtles throughout Southeast Asia for the curio trade. Over
the past decade, several reports of boats captured with hundreds and
hundreds of dead green turtles suggest this is a dire regional threat (N.
Pilcher, Marine Research Foundation, personal communication, 2007).
In addition to climate change and sea-level rise, natural impacts on green
turtles may include the effects of aperiodic hurricanes and catastrophic
environmental events such as tsunamis. In general, these events are
episodic and, although they may affect green turtle hatchling production,
the results are generally localized to a small area (but see Hamann et al.
2006b) and they rarely result in whole-scale losses over multiple nesting
seasons (Hamann et al. 2006b). The negative effects of hurricanes on
                         41

                       low-lying and/or developed shorelines may be longer-lasting and a
                       greater threat overall.
SUBSECTION B: ENDANGERED FLORIDA BREEDING POPULATION
While the ESA listing focuses on the Florida breeding population, it is important to note that
Florida also hosts numerous foraging populations of green turtles along a major portion of
the state's coastline (Figure 2). Because some of these turtles also nest in Florida, examining
the state's foraging population is also necessary for this evaluation.

B.2.3.1 Biology and Habitat
           B.2.3.1.1 New information on the species' biology and life history:
                       Florida green turtles undertake complex movements and migrations
                       through geographically disparate habitats during their lifetimes. Upon
                       leaving the nesting beach, hatchlings begin an oceanic phase, perhaps
                       floating passively in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-
                       ocean developmental grounds. This early oceanic phase remains one of
                       the most poorly understood aspects of green turtle life history (oceanic
                       refers to the vast open ocean environment from the surface to the sea
                       floor where water depths are greater than 200 meters). However, growth
                       studies using skeletochronology indicate that green turtles in the western
                                                         42

          Atlantic shift from this oceanic phase and recruit to neritic
          developmental areas predominantly as 5- to 6-year-olds (neritic refers to
          the inshore marine environment from the surface to the sea floor where
          water depths do not exceed 200 meters) (Zug and Glor 1998). These
          new arrivals recruit to protected lagoons and open coastal areas rich in
          sea grass and marine algae (Bresette et al. 2006) and this 'first stop' in
          their developmental migration may last for up to 6 years, after which
          time turtles may shift to other sites as larger juveniles/subadults (Musick
          and Limpus 1997, Zug and Glor 1998). While in coastal habitats, green
          turtles exhibit site fidelity to specific areas or home ranges (Bresette et
          al. 1998, Makowski et al. 2006), and it is clear that they can home in on
          these sites if displaced (e.g., from cold-stunning, McMichael et al.
          2003). The size class structure and seasonality of green turtles in
          Florida's foraging areas have been increasingly monitored (Bresette et
          al. 1998, Bagley 2003, Kubis et al. 2003, McMichael et al. 2006).
          As adults, green turtles commence breeding migrations between
          foraging grounds and nesting areas that are undertaken every few years
          (Plotkin 2003). Reproductive migrations of Florida green turtles have
          been identified through flipper tagging and satellite telemetry. Based on
          these studies, the majority of adult female Florida green turtles are
          believed to reside in nearshore foraging areas throughout the Florida
          Keys from Key Largo to the Dry Tortugas and in the waters southwest
          of Cape Sable, Florida and some post-nesting Florida green turtles also
          reside in Bahamian waters (B. Schroeder, NMFS, personal
          communication, 2007).
          Green turtle nesting ecology in Florida has been the focus of research for
          several decades. Annual reproductive effort, hatching success, and
          spatial nesting patterns of green turtles in Florida have also been the
          subject of several new studies (Weishampel et al. 2003, 2006; Antworth
          et al. 2006). In addition, the effects of environmental factors on
          reproductive periodicity have been examined recently (Weishampel et
          al. 2003).
B.2.3.1.2 Abundance, trends, and demography:
          B.2.3.1.2.1. Abundance and trends
          Green turtle nesting abundance in the state of Florida has been
          monitored for nearly three decades and has been the focus of numerous
          reports (Dodd 1982, Conley and Hoffman 1987, Meylan et al. 1995,
          Ehrhart and Bagley 1999, Witherington and Koeppel 2000, Ehrhart et al.
          2003, Meylan et al. 2006, Chaloupka et al. in review). Like several of
          the more recent reports, data presented in this evaluation were gathered
          as part of two initiatives within the state: the Statewide Nesting Beach
          Survey (SNBS) and Index Nesting Beach Survey (INBS) programs. The
          purpose of the SNBS, initiated in 1979, is to document total distribution,
          seasonality, and abundance of sea turtle nesting in Florida. The INBS
                                   43

program was started in 1989 in an effort to determine nesting trends at a
set number of beaches. Of the 190 SNBS sites, 33 participate in the
INBS program, and the nesting trend in Florida since 1989 is derived
from these 33 index beaches. Data in this evaluation are based on the
number of nests deposited annually at each of these sites. Species
identifications and determinations of nesting or non-nesting emergences
are based on evaluations of features of tracks and nests (FFWCC 2007).
We have high confidence in the results from both surveys, but there are
several caveats and limitations of using nest counts as an indicator of
population trends (see Subsection A.2.3.1.2.1).
In addition to the overall nesting trend as determined by the INBS, this
report provides a measure of current annual nesting activity. This value
is based on data collected as part of the SNBS and is based on the mean
nesting abundance from 2000-2006 throughout the state.
Nesting data collected during the SNBS (2000-2006) show that a mean
of approximately 5,600 nests are laid each year in Florida (Table 2).
Nesting occurs in 26 counties with a peak along the east coast, from
Volusia through Broward Counties (Figure 2). During this period, the
counties with the greatest level of nesting activity were Brevard County,
with a mean of 2,582 nests/year, and Palm Beach County, with a mean
of 1,407 nests/year (FFWCC 2007).
The green turtle nesting population of Florida appears to be increasing
based on 18 years (1989-2006) of nesting data from throughout the state
(Figure 3). Indeed, quantitative analysis by Chaloupka et al. (in review)
for the Melbourne Beach area provides unequivocal evidence of an
increase over more than two decades. In viewing the trend graph, it is
important to note in the last four years there are three 'low' years.
However, considering that nearby nesting populations in Tortuguero
(Troëng and Rankin 2005) displayed a similar annual nesting pattern in
recent years, this observed decrease may be related to lesser
reproductive effort due to environmental variability at foraging grounds
rather than a decrease in number of nesting females.
The increase in nesting in Florida is likely a result of several factors,
including: (1) a Florida statute enacted in the early 1970s that prohibited
the killing of green turtles; (2) the ESA listing in 1973, affording
complete protection to eggs, juveniles, and adults in all U.S. waters; (3)
the passage of Florida's constitutional net ban amendment in 1994 and
its subsequent enactment, making it illegal to use any gillnets or other
entangling nets in state waters; (4) the likelihood that the majority of
Florida adult green turtles reside within Florida waters where they are
fully protected; (5) the protections afforded Florida green turtles while
they inhabit the waters of other nations that have enacted strong sea
turtle conservation measures (e.g., Bermuda); and (6) the listing of the
species on Appendix I of CITES, which stopped international trade and
reduced incentives for illegal trade from the U.S.
                        44

             Green turtles hatched on Florida beaches are migratory and occupy
             foraging and developmental habitats within the state as well as in coastal
             regions throughout the wider Caribbean. Although there are several
             research projects in Florida that involve the observation and capture of
             juvenile green turtles, few have a time series that would lend sufficient
             power to a trends analysis of abundance indices (sightings/captures as a
             function of effort). No Florida in-water project has had abundance
             indices incorporated into a rigorous analysis or a published trends
             assessment. Similarly, we are unable to make any conclusions regarding
             trends among in-water populations outside of Florida.

          B.2.3.1.2.2. Demography
          The primary demographic features of green turtles relevant for
          interpreting population abundance and long term trends include age-to-
          maturity (often via growth studies), reproductive longevity, reproductive
          output (i.e., egg production, clutch frequency, internesting interval), and
          annual survivorship. While these have been the subject of considerable
          research worldwide, there are comparatively few such advances for
          green turtles in Florida. A brief description of these aspects follows.
          For a broader discussion on green turtle demography, including
          information on survivorship and age-to-maturity, go to Subsection
          A.2.3.1.2.2.
          Green turtles exhibit variable growth rates in different neritic habitats in
          Florida. So far, studies using capture-mark-recapture techniques as well
          as skeletochronology have concluded that growth may vary depending
          on the study location and size range of turtles. Along the east coast of
          Florida - in Mosquito Lagoon and open coast near St. Lucie Inlet -
          juvenile green turtles exhibit non-monotonic growth, with annual
          increases ranging from 2-5 cm per year (Zug and Glor 1998, Bresette
          and Gorham 2001). In St. Joseph's Bay along the Florida panhandle,
          juvenile growth is also non-monotonic, ranging from 2-8 cm per year
          (McMichael et al. 2006).
          Although no estimates of reproductive longevity are available for
          Florida, data from Tortuguero (Carr et al. 1978) and Aves Island (Vera
          2007) suggest that green turtles in the Wider Caribbean may remain
          reproductive for up to 23 years. Considering that the mean remigration
          intervals for Florida nesters is 2 years (Bjorndal et al. 1983,
          Witherington and Ehrhart 1989), a reproductive life span of this duration
          would result in a female nesting during 11-12 seasons over the course of
          her life. Florida green turtles nest 3-4 times per season (Johnson 1994)
          and deposit a mean of 136 eggs per nest (Witherington and Ehrhart
          1989). Thus, a female may make 33-48 nests, or about 4,500-6,500
          eggs, during her lifetime. These crude calculations suggest that Florida
          green turtles are among the most fecund nesting populations worldwide
          (for comparison see Hirth 1997).
B.2.3.1.3 Genetics and genetic variation:
          The genetic substructure of the green turtle regional subpopulations
          shows distinctive genetic properties for each nesting rookery (Bowen et
          al. 1992, FitzSimmons et al. 2006). See Subsection A.2.3.1.3 for a
          discussion of the regional genetic patterns for green turtles, as well as
          the implications of the decrease at, and loss of, nesting concentrations.
          In addition to studies examining the global genetic structure for green
          turtles, there have been recent efforts to determine the nesting population
          origins of green turtles assembled in Florida foraging areas.
                                 46

          Mitochondrial DNA analyses show numerous haplotypes for green
          turtles in Florida developmental habitats, and indicate that the juveniles
          assembled in these areas originate from Barbados, Costa Rica, Florida,
          Mexico, Venezuela, and Suriname (Bass and Witzell 2000, Bagley et al.
          2000, Bolker et al. 2007). Studies from other areas within the Wider
          Caribbean similarly show that green turtles originating from Florida
          nesting beaches are present, as juveniles, in foraging grounds throughout
          the Wider Caribbean, including the Bahamas, Cuba, southeastern U.S.,
          Barbados, and Venezuela (Lahanas et al. 1998, Luke et al. 2004, Bass et
          al. 2006, Moncada et al. 2006, Bolker et al. 2007).
B.2.3.1.4 Taxonomic classification:
          The taxonomic classification for the green turtle has not changed since
          the species was listed. It remains as follows:
          Kingdom: Animalia
          Phylum: Chordata
          Class: Reptilia
          Order: Testudines
          Family: Cheloniidae
          Genus: Chelonia
          Species: mydas
          Common name: Green sea turtle
B.2.3.1.5 Spatial distribution:
          Nesting occurs in all coastal counties except those in the Big Bend area
          of Florida (Table 2, Figure 2). The highest nesting densities are located
          along the southeast coast from Brevard to Palm Beach Counties
          (FFWCC 2007). Green turtles nesting in Florida depart to foraging
          areas located throughout the Florida Keys and, to a lesser extent, the
          Bahamas (see Subsection B.2.3.1.1).
          In addition to nesting beaches, green turtles are found in coastal waters
          throughout the state (Witherington et al. 2006). Several neritic habitats
          along the east coast of Florida have been identified as important areas
          for green turtles, including Mosquito and Indian River Lagoons
          (Bresette et al. 2002, Bagley 2003, Kubis et al. 2003), Port Canaveral
          (Schmid 1995, Redfoot and Ehrhart 2000), St. Lucie Inlet (Bresette et al.
          2002), and Biscayne Bay (Cantillo et al. 2000). Juveniles also reside at
          shallow coastal reefs adjacent to the high energy coastline of eastern
          Florida; their presence has been documented from Brevard to Broward
          Counties (Schmid 1995, Bresette et al. 1998, Broadstone et al. 2003,
          Holloway-Adkins 2006, Holloway-Adkins et al. 2006, Makowski et al.
          2006). Along the shores of southwestern Florida, green turtles have
          been documented in the Florida Keys (Witherington et al. 2006), Florida
          Bay (Schroeder et al. 1998), the Marquesas (M. Bresette, Quantum
          Resources, Inc., personal communication, 2007), the Dry Tortugas
                                  47

                   (Reardon and Mansfield 2002), and the western Everglades (Witzell and
                   Schmid 2004). Along Florida's Gulf of Mexico (west) coast, green
                   turtles have been documented at places such as the Everglades and St.
                   Joseph's Bay (Schmid 1998, McMichael et al. 2006).
                   Because of the migratory nature of green turtles, individuals from the
                   Florida nesting population also move to areas outside Florida. These
                   sites within the Wider Caribbean include, but are not necessarily limited
                   to the Bahamas, Barbados, Cuba, Puerto Rico, southeastern U.S., and
                   Venezuela (Lahanas et al. 1998, Luke et al. 2004, Bass et al. 2006,
                   Moncada et al. 2006, Bolker et al. 2007, Diez and van Dam 2007).
                   Again, it is likely that additional areas are visited by green turtles,
                   although to date the lack of flipper tagging recoveries and/or genetic
                   analysis of green turtles assembled in these distant foraging areas have
                   resulted in a lack of information for most areas.

                   See Subsection A.2.3.1.6.
B.2.3.2 Five-Factor Analysis (threats, conservation measures, and regulatory
        mechanisms)
        The determination to list a species under the ESA is based on the best scientific and
        commercial data regarding five listing factors (see below). Subsequent 5-year
        reviews must also make determinations about the listing status based, in part, on
        these same factors.
        B.2.3.2.1 Present or threatened destruction, modification or curtailment of its
                   habitat or range:
                   In Florida, there are increasing impacts to the nesting and marine
                   environments that affect green turtles throughout the state. Structural
                   impacts to nesting habitat include the construction of buildings and
                   pilings, beach armoring and renourishment, and sand extraction
                   (Lutcavage et al. 1997, Bouchard et al. 1998, Mosier 1998, Mosier and
                   Witherington 2002, Leong et al. 2003, Roberts and Ehrhart 2003).
                   These factors may directly, through loss of beach habitat, or indirectly,
                   through changing thermal profiles and increasing erosion, serve to
                   decrease the amount of nesting area available to nesting females, and
                   may evoke a change in the natural behaviors of adults and hatchlings
                   (Ackerman 1997, Schroeder and Mosier 2000). In addition, coastal
                   development is usually accompanied by artificial lighting. The presence
                   of lights on or adjacent to nesting beaches alters the behavior of nesting
                   adults (Witherington 1992) and is often fatal to emerging hatchlings as
                   they are attracted to light sources and drawn away from the water
                   (Witherington and Bjorndal 1991, Nelson-Sella et al. 2006). These
                   threats have been well documented along the coastal stretches of Florida,
                   and although comparatively few data are available for outlying regions,
                                            48

          it is likely that they are also impacting Florida green turtles in areas
          outside the state. See Subsection A.2.3.2.1 for more information.
          Anthropogenic disturbances also threaten coastal marine habitats,
          particularly areas rich in seagrass and marine algae, key forage species
          for Florida green turtles (see Subsection A.2.3.2.1 for further
          discussion).
B.2.3.2.2 Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or
educational purposes:
          As in other areas worldwide, green turtles originating from Florida
          nesting beaches are vulnerable from anthropogenic impacts during all
          life-stages: from eggs to adults. These include egg harvest, the killing of
          females on nesting beaches, and directed hunting of green turtles in
          foraging areas. While these threats have been largely eliminated in
          Florida due to successful conservation measures, the hunting of juvenile
          and adult turtles continues both legally and illegally in many foraging
          areas where green turtles originating from Florida are known to occur
          (Fleming 2001, Chacon 2002). However, the mortality caused by direct
          hunting is difficult to quantify and therefore it is not possible to
          characterize how detrimental this threat is to the Florida population.
B.2.3.2.3 Disease or predation:
          While green turtles in Florida have demonstrated encouraging signs of
          recovery after more than 20 years of protection efforts, the high
          incidence of fibropapillomatosis among foraging populations threatens
          to curb these improvements. This disease is a condition for which the
          particular causes remain unknown, although within specific locations, an
          FP outbreak can be linked to a predominant viral variant that is endemic
          in that habitat (Ene et al. 2005). This disease is characterized by the
          presence of internal and external tumors (fibropapillomas) that may
          grow large enough to hamper swimming, vision, feeding, and potential
          escape from predators (Herbst 1994).
          The population-level impacts to Florida green turtles are not fully
          understood. However, the fact that 22% of the 6,027 green turtles
          stranded in Florida from 1980-2005 had external FP tumors suggests
          that this disease is of serious consequence for population stability
          (FFWCC 2007, Singel et al. 2003). FP continues to be a major problem
          in the Indian River Lagoon system (28-72% affliction) and along the
          nearshore reefs of central eastern Florida (8-21%). Interestingly,
          however, FP remains absent at Port Canaveral, a site relatively close to
          these aforementioned sites (Hirama and Ehrhart 2003). A comparison of
          FP rates at two sites near St. Lucie County found a similar pattern of
          presence/absence, with the intake canal of St. Lucie power plant
          showing low incidence (3.2 and 2.9% in 1999 and 2000, respectively)
          versus high incidence in the nearby Indian River Lagoon (59.4 and
          70.2% in 1999 and 2000, respectively) (Bresette et al. 2005). Between
                                   49

          1980 and 1998, all green turtle strandings with signs of FP were found in
          southern Florida where over 20% of all green turtles exhibited FP (Foley
          et al. 2005). Since 1998, some green turtles with FP have stranded in
          northeast and northwest Florida (A. Foley, Florida Fish and Wildlife
          Conservation Commission, personal communication, 2007).
          Photographic evidence from Hawaii shows that the tumors on some
          green turtles go into recession (Bennett et al. 2000). The implications of
          tumor recession are still not fully understood, although it is indicative
          that FP may not be lethal in all cases. Clearly there remains much to be
          learned about FP, and it is clear that future research should address
          aspects such as the physical impact of tumor presence, the rates of
          regression, and the spatiotemporal change in affliction rate at the sites
          where FP is known to occur (Work et al. 2004).
          Although FP can be considered a natural disease, there is speculation
          that the prevalence of this disease has reached epidemic proportions due
          to immunosuppression in green turtles brought about by human-related
          habitat degradation (George 1997). Other potential causes that have
          received attention in Florida include the ingestion of the toxic alga
          Prorocentrum spp. (Holloway-Adkins 2001, Anderson 2002), as well as
          a variety of environmental factors (Foley et al. 2005). However, no
          definite cause has been determined. The widespread incidence of FP
          should be taken into consideration when determining the ESA listing
          status of Florida green turtles.
          With respect to predation, green turtles are heavily impacted in some
          areas by sharks (e.g., Heithaus 2001), but terrestrial predators such as
          ants and terrestrial vertebrates appear to be a much larger problem for
          green turtle survival. Fire ants have been shown to cause high hatchling
          mortality (Allen et al. 2001), and the presence of vertebrate predators
          such as dogs and raccoons also impact hatchlings as well as unhatched
          eggs (Engeman et al. 2005). While these threats have been mitigated in
          some areas such as Florida (Engeman et al. 2005), they are very
          problematic in some areas and have led to catastrophic hatchling
          mortality in some cases.
B.2.3.2.4 Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms:
          Conservation and recovery of sea turtles, and green turtles particularly,
          is facilitated by a number of regulatory instruments at international,
          regional, national, and local levels. Considering the distribution of
          Florida green turtles throughout the Wider Caribbean, virtually every
          instrument that targets or impacts sea turtles in the region is almost
          certain to cover green turtles. A list of the main regulatory instruments
          in this region follows. Please see Subsection A.2.3.2.4 for a description
          of each instrument.
                                  50

                  - United States Magnuson-Stevens Conservation and Management Act
                  - Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea
                    Turtles
                  - Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals
                  - Convention on Biological Diversity
                  - Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild

                  - Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine -
                    Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region
        B.2.3.2.5 Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence:
                  There are several other manmade factors that affect green turtles from
                  the Florida nesting population. These threats occur on Florida's nesting
                  beaches as well as in foraging areas within the state, in other areas of the
                  U.S., and in the Wider Caribbean. Because of the dispersal of green
                  turtles nesting in Florida to areas throughout the Wider Caribbean and
                  Gulf of Mexico, human threats outside of Florida may also have
                  profound impacts on the local breeding population (e.g., directed killing,
                  fisheries bycatch; see Subsection A.2.3.2.5). Standing out as one of the
                  major threats to green turtles in Florida waters - which is a byproduct of
                  the burgeoning human population - is the impact of boat strikes. Boat
                  strikes were the most common injury among the 4,542 green turtles
                  stranded along the coast of Florida from 1980-2001 (Singel et al. 2003).
                  For discussion of the impacts of directed hunting on green turtles
                  originating from Florida, see Subsection B.2.3.2.2. For information on
                  other natural and manmade factors such as debris ingestion and
                  entanglement, intake in coastal power plants, the effects from petroleum
                  spills, and the impacts from catastrophic storms, see Subsection
                  A.2.3.2.5.
SUBSECTION C: ENDANGERED PACIFIC MEXICO BREEDING POPULATION
C.2.3.1 Biology and Habitat
        C.2.3.1.1 New information on the species' biology and life history:
                  Also called black turtles, green turtles nesting along the Pacific mainland
                  coast and offshore islands of Mexico inhabit numerous habitats over the
                  course of their lives. Upon leaving the nesting beaches along the
                  mainland coast of Michoacan and offshore Revillagigedos Islands
                  (Figure 4), hatchlings begin an oceanic phase, perhaps floating passively
                  in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean developmental
                  grounds. This early oceanic phase remains one of the most poorly
                  understood aspects of green turtle life history, although opportunistic
                  sightings in the eastern Pacific have increased our understanding of
                  where these areas are (Nichols et al. 2001). Once settling into coastal
                                          51

              habitats, developing green turtles reside in protected lagoons as well as
              open coastal areas rich in sea grass and marine algae (Figure 4; Seminoff
              et al. 2002a, 2006; Lopez-Mendilaharsu et al. 2005). Green turtles in
              the eastern Pacific Ocean - particularly those in foraging habitats of
              northwestern Mexico - are more omnivorous than green turtles in other
              areas of the world (Bjorndal 1997).

          Considerable research has focused on the biology of green turtles
          assembled in foraging areas north of Michoacan. In these 'northern'
          foraging areas, there is greater information on population size structure
          (Gardner and Nichols 2001, Seminoff et al. 2003, Koch et al. 2006),
          growth (Seminoff et al. 2002c), foraging ecology (Seminoff et al.
          2002b; Lopez-Mendilaharsu et al. 2003, 2005), daily movements and
          home range and habitat use (Seminoff 2000, Nichols et al. 2001,
          Seminoff et al. 2002a, Seminoff and Jones 2006), diving behavior
          (Seminoff et al. 2006), energetics (Jones et al. 2005), and health (Presti
          et al. 1999, Gardner 2003). Comparatively less is known about the
          ecology of green turtles in foraging areas south of Michoacan. Aside
          from population size structure and seasonality at the Poza de Nance
          lagoon in northern Guatemala (Figure 4; C. Alfaro, Universidad de San
          Carlos, Guatemala, unpublished data), virtually no data are available for
          the 'southern' foraging areas. Furthermore, few data are available from
          oceanic foraging habitats, although data from neritic sites at the
          Revillagigedo Islands have demonstrated the seasonality and sizes of
          foraging turtles (Juarez-Ceron et al. 2003).
          There are several satellite telemetry studies that have demonstrated the
          migratory corridors used by green turtles as they move between nesting
          beaches and foraging grounds. Green turtles nesting in Michoacan
          follow a coastal migratory corridor, usually remaining within 100 km of
          the mainland coast as they depart to the north and south (Nichols 2003a;
          J. Nichols, The Ocean Conservancy, unpublished data; J. Seminoff,
          NMFS, unpublished data). Green turtles nesting in the Revillagigedos
          traverse oceanic regions as they move to coastal foraging areas along
          mainland Mexico and the Baja California Peninsula, and turtles moving
          north of the border to San Diego Bay, USA, follow a coastal trajectory
          as soon as they reach the Baja Peninsula (P. Dutton, NMFS, unpublished
          data).
          In addition to in-water ecology at foraging areas, a number of recent
          studies have examined the nesting biology and demography of green
          turtles in Pacific Mexico. This research has focused on clutch frequency
          (Alvarado-Diaz et al. 2003), hatching success (Juarez-Ceron et al.
          2003), hatchling sex ratio (Hernandez-Molina and Alvarado-Diaz 2005),
          as well as the impact of El Niño on reproductive output (Fuentes et al.
          2000).
C.2.3.1.2 Abundance, trends, and demography:
          C.2.3.1.2.1. Abundance and trends
          There is one primary nesting concentration (Colola - Michoacan) and
          three lesser nesting sites (Maruata, Michoacan; Clarion Island,
          Revillagigedos Archipelago; and Socorro Island, Revillagigedos
          Archipelago) in Pacific Mexico. Recent nesting abundance is provided
          for these four sites based on the mean number of nests deposited
                                  53

annually over the course of multiple nesting seasons (since 2000 when
possible) (Table 4). Annual reproductive effort has been monitored
continuously since the 1981-1982 nesting season at Colola and from
1981-1995 and 2003-2006 at Maruata. These efforts have been carried
out by biologists from the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicholas
Hidalgo. Nesting on the Revillagigedos Islands has been monitored by
biologists from the Universidad Autonoma de Mexico (Mexico City) as
well as by federal biologists from the Mexican fisheries management
agency Secretary of the Environment and Natural Resources
(SEMARNAT).

Mexico.

 Revillagigedos   (3 years)    (49-92 nests)
Based on these nesting beach monitoring efforts, it is apparent that a
mean of roughly 6,050 nests are deposited each year in Pacific Mexico.
However, the estimate for Maruata is based on a single season, which
suggests that this contribution to the overall mean should be viewed with
caution.
In addition to the current abundance at each site, the long-term trend in
nesting activity is provided for Colola, the largest nesting concentration
in Pacific Mexico. See Subsection A.2.3.1.2.1 for a summary of the
assumptions, caveats, and limitations of using annual reproductive effort
to determine population trends. Based on the 25-year trend line (Figure
5), green turtle nesting has increased since the population's low point in
the mid 1980s to mid 1990s. This observed increase may have resulted
from the onset of nesting beach protection in 1979 - as is suggested by
the similarity in timing between the onset of beach conservation and the
age-to-maturity for green turtles in Pacific Mexico. The initial upward
turn in annual nesting was seen in 1996, about 17 years after the
initiation of a nesting beach protection program (Cliffton et al. 1982,
Alvarado et al. 2001), and growth data from the Gulf of California
suggest that green turtles mature at about 15-25 years (modified from
Seminoff et al. 2002c). Although not a clear cause of the increasing
nesting trend, the consistency in timing is nonetheless compelling. The
presidential decree protecting all sea turtles of Mexico (Diario Oficial de
la Federacion 1990) certainly helped the situation, but this occurred
much later than the start of nesting beach conservation. It is more likely
                          54

that this national legislation has had its greatest positive impact at the
foraging areas, where green turtle hunting was once rampant.

Mexico. Data courtesy of J. Alvarado and C. Delgado Trejo,

In addition to the preceding discussion of nesting abundance and long-
term trends, the status of green turtles is described below for five regions
in Mexico. These include Northwestern Mexico, Michoacan,
Revillagigedos Islands, Tres Marias Islands, and Remainder of Coast
(including all nesting areas not covered in the other four categories).
Northwestern Mexico
The coastal waters of northwestern Mexico are an incredibly important
foraging region for turtles originating from mainland Mexico, as well as
from the Revillagigedos Islands (Seminoff 2000; Nichols 2003a; P.
Dutton et al., NMFS, unpublished data). It is difficult to quantify long-
term population trends among foraging populations in this area because
scientific studies of turtles in marine habitats have only been ongoing
since the early 1990s. However, based on comparisons of historic
fisheries data with more recent capture program data, it is apparent that
green turtles are at a fraction of their former abundance. The
tremendous declines are illustrated by the fact that nearly 500 turtles
were captured in only three weeks in 1961 at Bahia de los Angeles - a
major foraging area in the Gulf of California - whereas slightly more
than 300 turtles were captured at the same site using the same methods,
although slightly less effort, during a 10-year study (1995-2004;
Seminoff et al. 2003; J. Seminoff, NMFS, unpublished data.). Although
the population remains depleted relative to historic levels, anecdotal
information suggests that juvenile green turtles have become more
common in northwest Mexican foraging areas since the 1990 ban on
turtle use (Diario Oficial de la Federacion 1990).
                                  55

Michoacan
The highest nesting densities for the state of Michoacan are at Colola
and Maruata. Colola Beach is the main nesting beach and accounts for ~
74.4% of green turtle nesting in the State of Michoacan; Maruata
contains 24.1% of the nesting within the state (Delgado and Alvarado
2006; C. Delgado, Universidad Michoacana, personal communication,
2007). In addition, nesting in Michoacan occurs at the smaller beaches
of Xicuaza, La llorona, paso de Noria, Cachan, Ximapa, Motin del oro,
Arenas blancas, Cuilala, Chocola, La placita, and la Tikla; however,
nesting data for these been collected by the local fisheries commission
and multiple year data sets are currently unavailable. The longest-term
data available are for Colola, where nesting beach monitoring has been
ongoing every year since the 1981-1982 nesting season (Figure 5). An
estimate by Cliffton et al. (1982) places annual nesting for all of
Michoacan in the early 1970s at approximately 25,000 females.
However, this nesting population was likely already depleted by the time
of Cliffton's estimate, as major green turtle harvests along the Pacific
coast of Mexico had been ongoing for at least 60 years by that point
(Craig 1926).
Revillagigedos Islands
Despite its importance as a key nesting area for green turtles in Pacific
Mexico - both in terms of nesting numbers and genetic uniqueness - few
data are available. The three primary nesting sites are Academy Bay and
Playas Blancas on Clarion Island (Brattstrom 1982, Awbrey et al. 1984),
and Sulfur Bay on Socorro Island (Marquez 1990). From 1999-2001, a
mean of 47 nests were deposited each year at Socorro Island, and a mean
of 79 nests were deposited each year at Clarion Island (Juarez-Ceron et
al. 2003). Nesting activity at Clarion may be stable based on the fact
that Awbrey et al. (1984) counted 80 body pits in October 1976, and
believed these represented the entire nesting activity for that season.
However, as with all single year data sets, especially those based on
counts of body pits, the data should be viewed with extreme caution.
Tres Marias Islands
Tres Marias Islands is a small archipelago located around 90 km west of
the state of Nayarit, Mexico (Figure 4). Although little is known about
current nesting or in-water populations, we do know that these islands
were a favorite site to catch and store great quantities of sea turtles
during buccaneer days. The diaries of Edward Cooke and Woodes
Rogers provide testimony that these islands were an important breeding
ground for green turtles, as they both reported taking approximately 100
females in a night as provisions for the following weeks (Cooke 1712
(1969)). As recently as the late 1950s, green turtles were observed at
nesting beaches in the islands (Zweifel 1960). Virtually nothing is
                        56

known about the current status of green turtles at the Tres Marias
Islands, due largely to the fact that they are the site of a prison colony
and gaining legal access is nearly impossible (J. Seminoff, NMFS,
personal observation).
Remainder of Coast (Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco,
Colima, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas)
Solitary nesting by green turtles occurs throughout these areas (Seminoff
1994, NMFS and USFWS 1998b). Among the more important of these
areas for green turtle nesting are Barra de la Cruz (Oaxaca) and the coast
of Colima (Seminoff 1994). At Barra de la Cruz, < 20 nests were
documented during the 1992-1993 season (Seminoff 1994). On the
coast of Colima, approximately 30 nests were reported for Cuyatlan
during the 1993-1994 season (J. Seminoff, NMFS, unpublished data).
C.2.3.1.2.2. Demography
The primary demographic features of green turtles that are relevant for
interpreting population abundance and long term trends include age-to-
maturity (often via growth studies), reproductive longevity, reproductive
output (i.e., egg production, clutch frequency, internesting interval), and
annual survivorship. There have been several advances in our
knowledge of green turtle demography along the Pacific coast of
Mexico, which are described below. See Subsection A.2.3.1.3 for a
discussion of the regional genetic patterns for green turtles, as well as
the implications of the decrease at, and loss of, nesting concentrations.
Green turtles exhibit particularly slow growth rates and age-to-maturity
for the species appears to be the longest of any sea turtle (Chaloupka and
Musick 1997, Hirth 1997). Growth rates vary substantially among
Pacific Mexico foraging populations, ranging from 1.4 cm/year
(Seminoff et al. 2002c) to >5 cm/year (McDonald-Dutton and Dutton
1998), likely due to both varying diet quality and duration of foraging
season. Based on growth data from the Gulf of California, Seminoff et
al. (2002c) estimate that green turtles require from 9-21 years to reach
sexual maturity after settling into this neritic foraging area. However,
McDonald-Dutton and Dutton (1998) found very high growth rates for
green turtles inhabiting waters near the effluent of a power plant in San
Diego Bay, USA, suggestive of perhaps even faster maturation rates. It
is important to note that the growth rates for this site may benefit from
the unnaturally warm waters caused by the powerplant's effluent (J.
Seminoff, NMFS, unpublished data).
With respect to nesting activity, the lack of reliable reproductive
longevity estimates precludes an examination of total reproductive
output per female lifetime. However, information is available regarding
many of the general demographic aspects of green turtle nesting along
the Pacific coast of Mexico, and these aspects underscore the substantial
                        57

          differences in morphology and reproductive output between the
          Michoacan and Revillagigedos nesters. Females nesting in Michoacan
          are substantially smaller than those nesting in the Revillagigedos (82 cm
          versus 94 cm mean curved carapace length; Alvarado and Figueroa
          1990, Juarez-Ceron et al. 2003). The nesting season in Michoacan runs
          from September through January (Alvarado and Figueroa 1990), with
          females nesting every 3 years (Alvarado and Figueroa 1990) and
          depositing a mean of 3.1 nests per season (Alvarado-Diaz et al. 2003)
          with roughly 65.1 eggs per nest (Alvarado and Figueroa 1990). In the
          Revillagigedos Islands, nesting occurs from March through November
          with a peak in April/May (Brattstrom 1982, Awbrey et al. 1984), and
          although mean clutch frequency is unknown, there are substantially
          more eggs per nest (mean = 95 eggs; Juarez-Ceron et al. 2003).
          Hatching success of eggs incubated in situ in the Revillagigedos is 90%
          (Juarez-Ceron et al. 2003) compared to 92% and 89% for eggs incubated
          in situ in Colola and Maruata, respectively (C. Delgado, Universidad
          Michoacana, personal communication, 2007). In contrast, the most
          recent data for hatching success from eggs incubated in hatcheries in
          Colola and Maruata are 75.6% and 59.4%, respectively (C. Delgado,
          Universidad Michoacana, personal communication, 2007).
          Only one study has examined annual survivorship in the Pacific Mexico
          breeding population (Seminoff et al. 2003). This study found that, like
          other areas in the world, survivorship tends to be lower for juveniles and
          subadults (0.58) than for adult green turtles (0.97).
C.2.3.1.3 Genetics and genetic variation:
          The genetic substructure of the green turtle regional subpopulations
          shows distinctive genetic properties for each nesting rookery (Bowen et
          al. 1992, FitzSimmons et al. 2006). See Subsection A.2.3.1.3 for a
          discussion of the regional genetic patterns for green turtles, as well as
          the implications of nesting beach loss.
          Among nesting populations in Pacific Mexico, Dutton et al. (NMFS,
          unpublished data) have found substantial differences in the
          mitochondrial DNA haplotype frequencies between the Michoacan and
          Revillagigedos Islands rookeries. These differences suggest that the
          Revillagigedos nesting turtles are evolutionarily more closely related to
          nesting populations from Hawaii and the western Pacific (P. Dutton,
          NMFS, unpublished data), a dichotomy that is consistent with the larger
          size and greater reproductive output of Revillagigedos Island nesters.
          Recent efforts to determine the nesting population origins of green
          turtles assembled in foraging areas have found that green turtles from
          multiple nesting beach origins commonly mix at feeding areas in the
          Gulf of California (Nichols 2003a; P. Dutton, NMFS, unpublished data).
          Along the Pacific Mexico coast and in San Diego Bay (USA), the
          existing haplotype frequencies of foraging turtles suggests that these
                                 58

          sites have substantially greater input from the Revillagigedos Islands
          than from Michoacan, perhaps 100% of turtles coming from the
          Revillagigedos population at some sites (Nichols 2003a; P. Dutton et al.,
          NMFS, unpublished data). In addition, green turtles with eastern Pacific
          origins have been found, albeit rarely, in Hawaiian waters (LeRoux et al.
          2003, Dutton and Balazs in review) and Japanese waters (Kuroyanagi et
          al. 1999).
C.2.3.1.4 Taxonomic classification:
          The taxonomic classification for the green turtle has not changed since
          the species was listed. It remains as follows:
          Kingdom: Animalia
          Phylum: Chordata
          Class: Reptilia
          Order: Testudines
          Family: Cheloniidae
          Genus: Chelonia
          Species: mydas
          Common names: Green sea turtle, black sea turtle
          The green turtle is in the family Chelonidae and subfamily Cheloniinae
          (Deraniyagala 1953). The species is widely believed to be constituted
          by one species and subspecies, although in the eastern Pacific Ocean its
          species designation has been under tremendous scrutiny; some authors
          support full species status (e.g., Pritchard 1997, Figueroa 1989) whereas
          others support subspecies status (e.g., Bowen et al. 1992, Karl et al.
          1992, Parham and Zug 1996). This turtle was originally described as a
          full species, Chelonia agassizii, by Bocourt (1868). Carr (1952)
          described it as a subspecies, Chelonia mydas agassizii. However, in a
          later treatment Carr (1961) appeared to waver toward support of full
          species status as he recognized the unique coloration and shape of this
          turtle: "I would say that a complete novice in turtle study would be able
          to separate 95 to 98 percent of a mixed lot of Chelonia." Caldwell
          (1962) described the northeastern Pacific green turtle and provided the
          apparent subspecies synonym of Chelonia mydas carrinegra (the name
          is derived from Caldwell's colleague, Archie Carr, and the turtles' dark
          pigmentation). Figueroa (1989) examined skull characteristics of turtles
          from the Michoacan nesting rookery and those from the Caribbean
          nesting colony at Tortuguero, Costa Rica, and concluded that the
          agassizii-type was sufficiently dissimilar to Caribbean green turtles to
          warrant its status as a full species. Pritchard (1997) also justified full
          species status, stating that "agassizii- and mydas-like forms are
          sympatric in several places in the Pacific, including the Galapagos
          Islands and New Guinea; the degree of differentiation in size, shape, and
          color is more extreme than that found in any other Chelonia population;
          the dark plastral pigment of agassizii is not environmentally derived;
          and there may be purely physical reasons why a 40-kg adult male
                                  59

          agassizii may be unable to mate with a 200-kg female mydas, even if the
          two do come in contact." Subsequent contributions on the subject
          include that of Kamezaki and Matsui (1995) who examined 45 skulls
          from six nesting sites around the world including agassizii skulls from
          the Galapagos Islands and concluded that, though the agassizii form was
          unique, it did not warrant full species status. Similarly, genetic studies
          by Bowen et al. (1992) and Grady and Quattro (1999) found that East
          Pacific green turtles represented only a small subset of lineage diversity
          within the mitochondrial DNA gene tree for globally distributed
          Chelonia, and thus were deserving of no greater distinction than
          subspecies level. Studies by Karl et al. (1992) on nuclear DNA
          supported these findings.
C.2.3.1.5 Spatial distribution:
          Green turtle nesting occurs sporadically along much of the Pacific coast
          of Mexico from the state of Sinaloa south to Chiapas (Seminoff 1994),
          and near the tip of the Baja California Peninsula (Tiburcios Pintos et al.
          in press). The primary nesting sites, which are discussed above, include
          the beaches of Colola and Maruata in Michoacan, and Clarion and
          Socorro Islands in the Revillagigedos Archipelago.
          The primary foraging areas for this population stretch from the U.S.-
          Mexico border to the Guatemala-Mexico border (Figure 4), although
          some turtles from Michoacan have been found as far south as Colombia
          (Alvarado and Figueroa 1992). Coastal areas of northwest Mexico
          (Sonora, Baja California, and Baja California Sur) are perhaps the most
          important foraging sites for green turtles; the primary sites include all of
          the Gulf of California and the lagoons of Estero Coyote, Laguna San
          Ignacio, Laguna Ojo de Liebre, and Bahia Magdalena along the Pacific
          coast of the Baja Peninsula. In addition, Guadalupe Island - about 200
          km off the coast of Baja California - has recently been found to be a
          major green turtle feeding area (Figure 4; J. Seminoff, NMFS,
          unpublished data.). South of Michoacan, there are numerous lagoons
          and wetland areas that serve as foraging areas, including Laguna
          Corralero in Guerrero, Laguna Pastoria, Bahias Huatulco, and Laguna
          Mar Muerta in Oaxaca, and a series of lagoons along most of the
          Chiapas coast (Esteros San Francisco, Sambuquero, Chocohuital,
          Castañi, and Huetate) (J. Seminoff, NMFS, and L. Sarti, CONANP,
          unpublished data).
C.2.3.1.6 Habitat or ecosystem conditions:
          See Subsection A.2.3.1.6.
                                  60

C.2.3.2 Five-Factor Analysis (threats, conservation measures, and regulatory
        mechanisms)
        The determination to list a species under the ESA is based on the best scientific and
        commercial data regarding five listing factors (see below). Subsequent 5-year
        reviews must also make determinations about the listing status based, in part, on
        these same factors.
        C.2.3.2.1 Present or threatened destruction, modification or curtailment of its
                   habitat or range:
                   Impacts to green turtle habitat are diverse and widespread in Pacific
                   Mexico. Several of the lesser green turtle nesting beaches in Mexico
                   suffer from coastal development, a problem that is especially acute at
                   Maruata, a tourist site with tourist activity and heavy foot traffic during
                   the nesting season (Seminoff 1994). Artificial lighting is also a problem
                   in many of these areas. Other significant impacts on nesting beach
                   habitat include disturbances from feral and domestic animals (Figueroa
                   et al. 1993, Seminoff 1994).
                   With respect to marine habitat degradation, coastal habitats along the
                   Pacific coast of Mexico are relatively pristine and free from
                   contamination, although they too are likely modified today due to the
                   depletion of green turtles (see Subsection A.2.3.2.1). Coastal
                   development constitutes a major threat in several areas, perhaps none
                   more so than in northwest Mexico where the development of a large
                   marina network (Escallera Nautica) is planned for at least five major
                   foraging areas (Nichols 2003b). There are also a number of commercial
                   algae harvesting operations throughout this region that collect this
                   product for the production of industrial agar (Pacheco-Ruiz and
                   Zertuche-Gonzalez 1996). Although impacts from these ongoing and
                   proposed human activities are difficult to quantify, the recent human
                   population increase along the Baja California Peninsula underscores the
                   need to develop and implement management strategies that balance
                   development and economic activities with the needs of green turtles.
        C.2.3.2.2 Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or
                   educational purposes:
                   Green turtles, like other sea turtle species, are particularly vulnerable to
                   anthropogenic impacts during all life-stages: from eggs to adults. These
                   include egg harvest, the killing of females on nesting beaches, and
                   directed hunting of green turtles in foraging areas.
                   Egg Harvest
                   One of the most detrimental human threats to green turtles is the
                   intentional harvest of eggs from nesting beaches. As each nesting
                                           61

          season passes and populations continue to suffer from egg harvest, they
          will progressively lose the juvenile cohorts that would have recruited
          from the post-hatchling phase (Mortimer 1995). Present nesting
          populations may appear hardy, but without recruitment into the juvenile
          population and a well-balanced distribution of turtles among all cohorts,
          populations are more vulnerable to decline (Crouse et al. 1987, Frazer
          1992).
          At the largest green turtle nesting beach along the Pacific coast of
          Mexico, nearly all eggs were harvested for at least several decades prior
          to 1978 (Cliffton et al. 1982). In the mid 1970s, this harvest reached
          upwards of 70,000 eggs per night during the peak of the nesting season
          in Colola and 7,000-15,000 in Maruata (probably 100% of all nesters)
          (Cliffton et al. 1982). The problem persists today, albeit at substantially
          reduced levels (Alvarado-Diaz et al. 2001).
          Harvest of Nesting Females
          The killing of nesting females continues to threaten the stability of green
          turtle subpopulations. This directed take affects nesting populations
          both by reducing adult abundance and through reducing the population's
          potential for annual egg production. Ongoing harvest of nesting adults
          has been documented in Michoacan (Alvarado-Diaz et al. 2001).
          Hunting of Turtles in Foraging Habitats
          Mortality of turtles in foraging habitats continues to be problematic for
          recovery efforts in Pacific Mexico. Although subpopulations may be
          protected at nesting beaches, their large-scale in-water movements often
          take them to areas where protection is absent. Green turtles are hunted
          in many areas of northwest Mexico despite legal protection (Nichols et
          al. 2002; Seminoff et al. 2003; J. Seminoff, NMFS, personal
          observation). As recently as 2002, Nichols et al. (2002) described a
          black market that killed tens of thousands of green turtles each year.
          Although killing turtles is illegal, the consumption of turtle meat remains
          rampant in many social circles of Mexico and the southwest United
          States (Nichols and Safina 2004; J. Seminoff, NMFS, personal
          observation). Sustaining this culture of consumption is the tradition of
          eating turtle meat at fiestas, quinceaneras, and Semana Santa gatherings.
C.2.3.2.3 Disease or predation:
          No fibropapillomatosis has been documented in green turtles in Mexican
          foraging habitats, although a variant of FP has been found in one green
          turtle from San Diego Bay, USA (Greenblatt et al. 2005) that shared
          DNA affinities with the Mexican green turtle population (P. Dutton,
          NMFS, unpublished data). In addition, a few other turtles in San Diego
          Bay were believed to have the precursor to FP based on eye anomalies
          (McDonald-Dutton and Dutton 1990).
                                  62

C.2.3.2.4 Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms:
          The conservation and recovery of sea turtles, and green turtles
          particularly, is facilitated by a number of regulatory instruments at
          international, regional, national, and local levels. Considering the
          distribution of green turtles throughout Pacific Mexico, virtually every
          instrument that targets or impacts sea turtles in the region is almost
          certain to cover green turtles. A list of the main regulatory instruments
          in this region is provided below. Please see Subsection A.2.3.2.4 for a
          description of each instrument.
          It should also be pointed out that in 1990 a presidential decree was
          proclaimed that banned the use or sale of sea turtle products throughout
          all of Mexico (Diario Oficial de la Federacion 1990). Signed by then-
          President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, this was a monumental declaration
          on the part of the Mexican Government to prohibit the use of all sea
          turtle species in Mexico. It mandated fines and jail time for individuals
          caught with sea turtle products. However, the continued poaching of
          turtle eggs throughout the country and hunting of sea turtles in foraging
          areas, particularly in northwest Mexico, suggests this legislation has not
          achieved its intended goal (Nichols and Safina 2004).
          - United States Magnuson-Stevens Conservation and Management Act
          - FAO Technical Consultation on Sea Turtle-Fishery Interactions
          - Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea
             Turtles
          - Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals
          - Convention on Biological Diversity
          - Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
             Fauna and Flora
C.2.3.2.5 Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence:
          There are several other manmade factors that affect green turtles in
          Pacific Mexico. Because of the dispersal of green turtles nesting in
          Pacific Mexico to areas throughout the Eastern Pacific Ocean, human
          threats outside of Mexico may have profound impacts on the local
          breeding population (e.g., global warming, fisheries bycatch,
          contamination, vessel strikes, and intake in coastal power plants).
          Perhaps the most detrimental of these is fisheries bycatch in artisanal
          and industrial fishing. These fisheries practices include drift-netting,
          long-lining, set-netting, pound netting, and trawl fisheries, and their
          adverse impacts on sea turtles have been documented in marine
          environments throughout the world. See Subsection A.2.3.2.5. for
          further discussion of these impacts.
                                   63

2.4 Synthesis
THREATENED BREEDING POPULATIONS
Current nesting abundance trends were determined for 23 threatened nesting concentrations
among 11 ocean regions around the world. They included both large and small rookeries and
are believed to be representative of the overall trends for their respective regions. Of these
23 sites for which data enable an assessment of current trends, 10 nesting populations are
increasing, 9 are stable, and 4 are decreasing. Long-term continuous datasets ≥20 years are
available for 9 threatened population sites, all of which are either increasing or stable. These
include Ascension Island, Hawaii, Heron Island, Ogasawara Islands, Philippine Turtle
Islands, Sabah Turtle Islands, Sarawak, Terengganu, and Tortuguero. Despite the apparent
global increase in numbers, the positive overall trend should be viewed cautiously because
trend data are available for just over half of all sites examined. With respect to regional
trends, data from index sites suggest that some regions are doing better than others based on
available trend data. Nesting populations are doing relatively well (# increasing sites > #
decreasing sites) in the Pacific, Western Atlantic, and Central Atlantic Ocean. In contrast,
populations are doing relatively poorly in Southeast Asia, Eastern Indian Ocean, and perhaps
the Mediterranean.
Threats to nesting and marine habitats continue to affect threatened green turtle populations.
Continuing human population expansion into coastal areas is expected to increase the
severity of existing threats and is therefore a cause for major concern. Green turtles are also
highly vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts during all life-stages, and three of the biggest
threats result from harvest for commercial and subsistence use (e.g., egg harvest, the harvest
of females on nesting beaches, and directed hunting of green turtles in foraging areas).
Diseases, particularly fibropapillomatosis, threaten a large number of existing
subpopulations. Fisheries bycatch in artisanal and industrial fishing gear is also a major
impact. These fisheries practices include drift-netting, long-lining, set-netting, pound
netting, and trawl fisheries, and their adverse impacts on sea turtles have been documented in
marine environments throughout the world. In addition, increasing incidence of exposure to
heavy metals and other contaminants in the marine environment is of concern in some areas.
Additional factors affecting green turtles include boat traffic and its modification of green
turtle behavior in coastal areas, boat strikes as a major mortality source in some areas, the
ingestion of and entanglement in marine debris that can reduce food intake and digestive
capacity, and the interaction with oil spills.
ENDANGERED FLORIDA BREEDING POPULATION
The green turtle nesting population of Florida appears to be increasing based on 18 years
(1989-2006) of index nesting data from throughout the state. Although in the last four years
there are three 'low' years, this may be due to lesser reproductive effort as a result of
environmental variability at foraging grounds rather than a decrease in the number of nesting
females. The increase in nesting in Florida is likely a result of several factors, including: (1)
a Florida statute enacted in the early 1970s that prohibited the killing of green turtles in
Florida; (2) the species listing under the ESA in 1973, affording complete protection to eggs,
juveniles, and adults in all U.S. waters; (3) the passage of Florida's constitutional net ban
amendment in 1994 and its subsequent enactment, making it illegal to use any gillnets or
other entangling nets in state waters; (4) the likelihood that the majority of Florida adult
                                              64

green turtles reside within Florida waters where they are fully protected; (5) the protections
afforded Florida green turtles while they inhabit the waters of other nations that have enacted
strong sea turtle conservation measures (e.g., Bermuda); and (6) the listing of the species on
Appendix I of CITES, which stopped international trade and reduced incentives for illegal
trade from the U.S.
While nesting has increased, impacts to nesting beaches and the marine environment have
also increased. Among the most significant threats to nesting habitat in Florida are structural
impacts (e.g., construction of buildings, beach armoring, and beach renourishment) and
beachfront lighting. These activities result in direct habitat destruction and degradation
decreasing the extent and suitability of nesting sites on Florida beaches (e.g., increased
erosion, altered thermal profiles). The high incidence of fibropapillomatosis disease among
some foraging populations is a serious concern. Within U.S. waters, fisheries bycatch of
Florida green turtles remains a threat. Human threats (e.g., directed killing, fisheries
bycatch) outside of Florida may have profound impacts on the Florida breeding population
because of the dispersal of Florida green turtles to juvenile foraging areas throughout the
Wider Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Vessel strikes are a growing concern and, as human
populations increase in coastal areas, vessel strikes are likely to increase.
ENDANGERED PACIFIC MEXICO BREEDING POPULATION
There is one primary nesting concentration in Pacific Mexico (Colola, Michoacan) and three
lesser nesting sites (Maruata, Michoacan; Clarion Island, Revillagigedos Archipelago; and
Socorro Island, Revillagigedos Archipelago). Based on nesting beach monitoring efforts, a
mean of roughly 6,050 nests are deposited each year in Pacific Mexico. The only long-term
trend data available are for Colola, the largest nesting concentration in Pacific Mexico, where
nesting beach monitoring has been ongoing every year since the 1981-1982 nesting season.
Based on the 25-year trend line, it is clear that green turtle nesting has increased since the
population's low point in the mid 1980s to mid 1990s. This observed increase may have
resulted from the onset of nesting beach protection in 1979 - as is suggested by the similarity
in timing between the onset of beach conservation and the age-to-maturity for green turtles in
Pacific Mexico. The initial upward turn in annual nesting was seen in 1996, about 17 years
after the initiation of a nesting beach protection program, and growth data from the Gulf of
California suggest that green turtles mature at about 15-25 years. Although not a clear cause
of the increasing nesting trend, the consistency in timing is nonetheless compelling. The
1990 presidential decree protecting all sea turtles of Mexico certainly helped the situation,
but this occurred much later than the start of nesting beach conservation. It is more likely
that this national legislation has had its greatest positive impact at the foraging areas, where
green turtle hunting was once rampant.
Impacts to green turtle habitat are diverse and widespread in Pacific Mexico. Several of the
lesser green turtle nesting beaches in Mexico suffer from coastal development, a problem that
is especially acute at Maruata, a tourist site with tourist activity and heavy foot traffic during
the nesting season. Artificial lighting is also a problem in many of these areas. Other
significant impacts on nesting beach habitat include disturbances from feral and domestic
animals. Coastal development also constitutes a major threat to marine habitats in several
areas, perhaps none more so than in northwest Mexico where the development of a large
marina network is planned for at least five major foraging areas. Green turtles are also
highly vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts during all life-stages, and three of the biggest
                                              65

    threats result from harvest for commercial and subsistence use (e.g., egg harvest, the harvest
    of females on nesting beaches, and directed hunting of green turtles in foraging areas).
    Because of the dispersal of green turtles nesting in Pacific Mexico to areas throughout the
    Eastern Pacific Ocean, human threats (e.g., global warming, fisheries bycatch,
    contamination) outside of Mexico may have profound impacts on the local breeding
    population.
3.0 RESULTS
    3.1    Recommended Classification:
           3.1.1 Endangered population
                   Based on the best available information, we do not believe the breeding colony
                   populations in Florida and on the Pacific coast of Mexico should be delisted or
                   reclassified. However, for the current population listings for the green turtle
                   (both Endangered and Threatened), we have information that indicates an
                   analysis and review of the species should be conducted in the future to
                   determine the application of the DPS policy to the green turtle. See Section 4.0
                   for additional information.
           3.1.2   Threatened population
                   Based on the best available information, we do not believe the threatened green
                   turtle populations should be delisted or reclassified. However, for the current
                   population listings for the green turtle (both Endangered and Threatened), we
                   have information that indicates an analysis and review of the species should be
                   conducted in the future to determine the application of the DPS policy to the
                   green turtle. See Section 4.0 for additional information.
    3.2    New Recovery Priority Number: No change.
4.0 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE ACTIONS
    We have preliminary information that indicates an analysis and review of the species should
    be conducted in the future to determine the application of the DPS policy to the green turtle.
    Since the species’ listing, a substantial amount of information has become available on
    population structure (through genetic studies) and distribution (through telemetry, tagging,
    and genetic studies). The Services have not yet fully assembled or analyzed this new
    information; however, at a minimum, these data appear to indicate a possible separation of
    populations by ocean basins. To determine the application of the DPS policy to the green
    turtle, the Services intend to fully assemble and analyze this new information in accordance
    with the DPS policy. See Section 2.3 for new information since the last 5-year review.
    The current "Recovery Plan for U.S. Population of Atlantic Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas)"
    was completed in 1991, the "Recovery Plan for U.S. Pacific Populations of the Green Turtle
    (Chelonia mydas)" was completed in 1998, and the "Recovery Plan for U.S. Pacific
    Populations of the East Pacific Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas)" was completed in 1998. The
    recovery criteria contained in the plans, while not strictly adhering to all elements of the 2004
                                                  66

NMFS Interim Recovery Planning Guidance, are a viable measure of the species status. The
species biology, demographic trends, and population status information can be updated
where appropriate; however, the recovery actions identified in the plans are appropriate and
properly prioritized. While some additional recovery actions can no doubt be identified, the
Services believe that the current plans remain valid conservation planning tools. The
recovery plans should be re-examined over the next 5-10 year horizon, particularly if the
DPS analysis results in restructuring of the current listing, to update the plans to conform to
the 2004 NMFS Interim Recovery Planning Guidance. In the near-term, additional
information and data are particularly needed on genetic relationships among nesting
populations, impacts of coastal and pelagic fisheries, foraging areas and identification of
threats at foraging areas, and long-term population trends.

      Summary of peer review for the 5-year review of Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia mydas)
A. Peer Review Method: See B. below.
B. Peer Review Charge: On April 20, 2007, the following letter and Guidance for Peer
Reviewers of Five-Year Status Reviews were sent via e-mail to potential reviewers requesting
comments on the 5-year review. Requests were sent to Dr. Karen Bjorndal (University of Florida),
Dr. Carlos Delgado (Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, Mexico), Carlos Diez
(Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources), Dr. Colin Limpus
(Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service), Dr. Nicolas Pilcher (Marine Research Foundation,
Malaysia), and Dr. Blair Witherington (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission).
We request your assistance in serving as a peer reviewer of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and
National Marine Fisheries Service's (Services) 5-year status review of the green sea turtle
(Chelonia mydas). The 5-year review is required by section 4(c)(2) of the United States
Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). A 5-year review is a periodic process
conducted to ensure the listing classification of a species as threatened or endangered on the
Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants is accurate. The initiation of the
5-year review for the green turtle was announced in the Federal Register on April 21, 2005, and
the public comment period closed on July 20, 2005. Public comments have been incorporated into
the status review.
The enclosed draft of the status review has been prepared by the Services pursuant to the Act. In
keeping with directives for maintaining a high level of scientific integrity in the official documents
our agencies produce, we are seeking your assistance as a peer reviewer for this draft. Guidance
for peer reviewers is enclosed with this letter. If you are able to assist us, we request your
comments be received on or before May 18, 2007. Please send your comments to Sandy
MacPherson at the address on this letter. You may fax your comments to Sandy MacPherson at
904-232-2404 or send comments by e-mail to Sandy_MacPherson@fws.gov.
We appreciate your assistance in helping to ensure our decisions continue to be based on the best
available science. If you have any questions or need additional information, please contact Sandy
MacPherson at 904-232-2580, extension 110. Thank you for your assistance.
                                               Sincerely yours,
                                               David L. Hankla

                                          February 7, 2007
As a peer reviewer, you are asked to adhere to the following guidance to ensure your review
complies with Service policy.
Peer reviewers should:
1. Review all materials provided by the Service.
2. Identify, review, and provide other relevant data that appears not to have been used by the
Service.
3. Not provide recommendations on the Endangered Species Act classification (e.g.,
Endangered, Threatened) of the species.
4. Provide written comments on:
    • Validity of any models, data, or analyses used or relied on in the review.
    • Adequacy of the data (e.g., are the data sufficient to support the biological conclusions
        reached). If data are inadequate, identify additional data or studies that are needed to
        adequately justify biological conclusions.
    • Oversights, omissions, and inconsistencies.
    • Reasonableness of judgments made from the scientific evidence.
    • Scientific uncertainties by ensuring that they are clearly identified and characterized, and
        that potential implications of uncertainties for the technical conclusions drawn are clear.
    • Strengths and limitation of the overall product.
5. Keep in mind the requirement that we must use the best available scientific data in determining
   the species' status. This does not mean we must have statistically significant data on population
   trends or data from all known populations.
All peer reviews and comments will be public documents, and portions may be incorporated
verbatim into our final decision document with appropriate credit given to the author of the
review.
Questions regarding this guidance, the peer review process, or other aspects of the Service's
recovery planning process should be referred to Sandy MacPherson, National Sea Turtle
Coordinator, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, at 904-232-2580, extension 110, email:
Sandy_MacPherson@fws.gov.
C. Summary of Peer Review Comments/Report:
A summary of peer review comments from the four respondents is provided below. The complete
set of comments is available at the Jacksonville Ecological Services Field Office, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, 6620 Southpoint Drive South, Suite 310, Jacksonville, Florida, 32216.
                                                  100

Dr. Carlos Delgado, Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, Michoacán, Mexico:
Dr. Delgado provided information to update Subsection C for the endangered green turtle breeding
colony population on the Pacific coast of Mexico. He gave the most recent demographic
information for the nesting stock in Michoacan and gave suggestions on how to best characterize
the green turtles nesting in Colola and Maruata, Mexico.
Carlos Diez, Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, San Juan, Puerto
Rico: Mr. Diez commented that the assessment focused specifically on nesting beaches and
though he did not provide specific comments on the document, he did provide important
information regarding the presence of green turtles in foraging habitats of Puerto Rico that had
originated from Florida and other areas of the Caribbean.
Dr. Nicolas Pilcher, Marine Research Foundation, Sabah, Malaysia: Dr. Pilcher provided very
substantive comments relating to the data presented in Subsection A. He commented that while
the overall assessment was very accurate, there were a few data sources that were questionable and
he went on to provide additional data and contacts for people in the field from whom the most up
to date data were available. Dr. Pilcher also recommended that the evaluation make very clear that
most current populations are likely at a mere fraction of their historic abundance, regardless of the
current trend. Information regarding sea-level rise was also provided, and there were numerous
minor edits suggested throughout the document.
Dr. Blair Witherington, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Melbourne, FL,
USA: Dr. Witherington suggested that we use published information as much as possible to define
either increasing or decreasing trends, and that published trends assessments should take
precedence over the 5-year review author's determinations. He also suggested that all data in
Table 1 be converted to the same units (e.g., annual number of nesting females) so as to not
confuse the reader. He also suggested that we frame the data sets’ time series in terms of green
turtle generation time. For the Florida nesting population, he asked for further clarification
regarding the differences between the Florida nesting population and the foraging population.
More information was asked for regarding the impacts of global climate change, debris ingestion,
and oil spills on green turtles. Numerous minor edits were suggested.
D. Response to Peer Review:
Dr. Carlos Delgado, Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, Michoacán, Mexico:
All comments by Dr. Delgado were incorporated.
Carlos Diez, Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, San Juan, Puerto
Rico: The information on foraging green turtles was added.
Dr. Nicolas Pilcher, Marine Research Foundation, Sabah, Malaysia: All suggested edits and new
data suggested by Dr. Pilcher were incorporated. We attempted to contact two individuals for
more recent data, but received no reply. We also added substantial text throughout the document
to highlight the fact that most populations, even if currently increasing, stand at a small fraction of
their historic abundance.
Dr. Blair Witherington, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Melbourne, FL,
USA: All suggested minor edits were incorporated. We elected to keep the current use of
published and unpublished information in the evaluation. While true that in many cases
                                                 101

unpublished data are unverifiable, we believe that the unpublished data included in the review are
highly reliable. We did not change the units in Table 1 and instead adopted the second option
suggested by Dr. Witherington, which was to make a specific field in the Table that clearly
describes what units are used for each nesting site. We also provided more context about green
turtle generation times in light of the trends presented in the evaluation. We added text describing
the differences between the nesting and foraging populations in Florida. We added text providing
context to global climate change, as well as more information on debris ingestion and the impacts
from oil spills.
