    1.2. Methodology used to complete the review
         Dr. Manjula Tiwari of the National Marine Fisheries Service gathered and
         synthesized information regarding the status of the leatherback sea turtle. This
         review was subsequently compiled by a team of biologists from the National
         Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) Headquarters Office and the U.S. Fish and
         Wildlife Service's (FWS) Southeast Regional Office and the Jacksonville
         Ecological Services Field Office. Our sources include the final rule listing this
         species under the Act; the recovery plan; peer reviewed scientific publications;
         unpublished field observations by the Services, State, and other experienced
         biologists; unpublished survey reports; and notes and communications from other
         qualified biologists. The draft 5-year review was sent out for peer review to eight
         academic professionals with expertise on the species and its habitats. Peer
         reviewers were provided guidance to follow during the review process.
         Comments received from peer reviewers were incorporated into the 5-year review
         document (see Appendix). The public notice for this review was published on
         April 21, 2005, with a 90 day comment period (70 FR 20734). A few comments
         were received and incorporated as appropriate into the 5-year review.

1.3.2   Listing history
Original Listing
FR notice: 35 FR 8491
Date listed: June 2, 1970
Entity listed: Species
Classification: Endangered
1.3.3   Associated rulemakings
Regulations Consolidation Final Rule: 64 FR 14052, March 23, 1999. The
purpose of this rule was to make the regulations regarding implementation of the
Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) by NMFS for marine species more
concise, better organized, and therefore easier for the public to use.
Critical Habitat Designation: 43 FR 43688, September 26, 1978. The purpose of
this rule was to designate terrestrial critical habitat for the leatherback turtle as
follows: U.S. Virgin Islands – A strip of land 0.2 miles wide (from mean high
tide inland) at Sandy Point Beach on the western end of the island of St. Croix
beginning at the southwest cape to the south and running 1.2 miles northwest and
then northeast along the western and northern shoreline, and from the southwest
cape 0.7 miles east along the southern shoreline. 44 FR 17711, March 23, 1979.
Critical habitat was designated for waters adjacent to Sandy Point, St. Croix, U.S.
Virgin Islands, up to and inclusive of the waters from the hundred fathom curve
shoreward to the level of mean high tide.

Conclusion: Retain the listing as endangered throughout its range.
FWS also conducted 5-year reviews for the leatherback in 1985 (50 FR 29901)
and in 1991 (56 FR 56882). In these reviews, the status of many species was
simultaneously evaluated with no in-depth assessment of the five factors or
threats as they pertain to the individual species. The notices stated that FWS was
seeking any new or additional information reflecting the necessity of a change in
the status of the species under review. The notices indicated that if significant
data were available warranting a change in a species' classification, the Service
                                   2

          would propose a rule to modify the species' status. No change in the leatherback's
          listing classification was recommended from these 5-year reviews.
          1.3.5    Species’ recovery priority number at start of review
          National Marine Fisheries Service = 1 (this represents a high magnitude of threat,
          a high recovery potential, and the presence of conflict with economic activities).
          U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (48 FR 43098) = 1 (this represents a monotypic
          genus with a high degree of threat and a high recovery potential).

2.0 REVIEW ANALYSIS
2.1 Application of the 1996 Distinct Population Segment (DPS) policy
    2.1.1 Is the species under review a vertebrate?
          Yes.
    2.1.2 Is the species under review listed as a DPS?
          No.
    2.1.3 Is there relevant new information for this species regarding the application
          of the DPS policy?
          Yes. Although the Services believe the current listing is valid based on the best
          available information, we have preliminary information that indicates an analysis
          and review of the species should be conducted in the future to determine the
          application of the DPS policy to the leatherback. Since the species’ listing, a
          substantial amount of information has become available on population structure
          (through genetic studies) and distribution (through telemetry, tagging, and genetic
          studies). The Services have not yet fully assembled or analyzed this new
          information; however, at a minimum, these data appear to indicate a possible
          separation of populations by ocean basins. To determine the application of the
                                            3

          DPS policy to the leatherback, the Services intend to fully assemble and analyze
          this new information in accordance with the DPS policy. See Section 2.3 for new
          information since the last 5-year review and Section 4.0 for additional
          information.
2.2 Recovery Criteria
    2.2.1 Does the species have a final, approved recovery plan containing objective,
          measurable criteria?
          No. The "Recovery Plan for Leatherback Turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the
          U.S. Caribbean, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico" was signed in 1992 and the
          "Recovery Plan for U.S. Pacific Populations of the Leatherback Turtle
          (Dermochelys coriacea)" was signed in 1998. While not all of the recovery
          criteria strictly adhere to all elements of the 2004 NMFS Interim Recovery
          Planning Guidance, they are still a viable measure of the species status. See
          Section 4.0 for additional information.
          The recovery criteria for the two active recovery plans are identified below, along
          with several key accomplishments:
          1992 Recovery Plan for Leatherback Turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the U.S.
          Caribbean, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico:
          The U.S. population of leatherbacks can be considered for delisting if the
          following conditions are met:
          1. The adult female population increases over the next 25 years, as evidenced by
              a statistically significant trend in the number of nests at Culebra, Puerto Rico,
              St. Croix, USVI, and along the east coast of Florida.
              - A Leatherback Turtle Expert Working Group with national and international
                participants was convened from 2004-2006 to gather and assess the latest,
                most complete data available on Atlantic leatherback nesting and population
                information.
              - In Puerto Rico, the main nesting areas are at Fajardo on the main island of
                Puerto Rico and on the island of Culebra. Between 1978 and 2005, nesting
                increased in Puerto Rico from a minimum of 9 nests recorded in 1978 and to
                a minimum of 469-882 nests recorded each year between 2000 and 2005.
                Annual population growth rate was estimated to be 1.1 with a growth rate
                interval between 1.04 and 1.12 using nest numbers between 1978 and 2005.
              - In the U.S. Virgin Islands, leatherback nesting on the Sandy Point National
                Wildlife Refuge on the island of St. Croix has been monitored each nesting
                season since 1977. Researchers estimated a population growth of
                approximately 13% per year on Sandy Point from 1994 through 2001.
                Between 1990 and 2005, the number of nests recorded has ranged from a
                low of 143 in 1990 to a high of 1,008 in 2001. The average annual growth
                                              4

     rate was calculated as approximately 1.10 (with an estimated interval of
     1.07, 1.13) using the number of observed females at Sandy Point, St. Croix,
     from 1986 to 2004.
   - In Florida, a Statewide Nesting Beach Survey program has documented an
     increase in leatherback nesting numbers from 98 nests in 1989 to between
     800 and 900 nests per season in the early 2000s. Based on the standardized
     nest counts made at Index Nesting Beach Survey sites surveyed with
     constant effort over time (1989-2006), there has been a substantial increase
     in leatherback nesting in Florida since 1989. The estimated annual growth
     rate was approximately 1.18 with estimated 95% posterior interval of
     approximately 1.1-1.21.
2. Nesting habitat encompassing at least 75 percent of nesting activity in USVI,
   Puerto Rico and Florida is in public ownership.
   - Several key properties are in Federal ownership as National Wildlife
     Refuges in Florida (Archie Carr and Hobe Sound), Puerto Rico (Culebra and
     Vieques), and the U.S. Virgin Islands (Sandy Point). The extent of nesting
     activity occurring on properties in protected ownership has not yet been
     assessed.
3. All priority one tasks have been successfully implemented.
   - Research and monitoring have been conducted in Canada on one of the
     largest seasonal foraging populations of leatherbacks in the Atlantic (task
     121).
   - In cooperation with Canada, threats to leatherback turtles in Canadian
     waters have been identified and addressed, and contributed to the
     development of recovery plans for leatherback turtles in Canada (task 121).
   - Nest monitoring and nest protection efforts are ongoing at several National
     Wildlife Refuges in Florida (Archie Carr and Hobe Sound), Puerto Rico
     (Culebra and Vieques), and the U.S. Virgin Islands (Sandy Point), as well as
     on other beaches throughout the species U.S. nesting range (task 212).
   - Regulations requiring year-round use of TEDs by most shrimp trawlers
     operating in southeastern U.S. waters were required after December 1992
     and modifications to improve turtle exclusion have been codified (task
     2221).
   - Efforts are ongoing to provide TED outreach and training for various
     foreign governments (task 2221).
1998 Recovery Plan for U.S. Pacific Populations of the Leatherback Turtle
   (Dermochelys coriacea):
To consider de-listing, all of the following criteria must be met:
1. All regional stocks that use U.S. waters have been identified to source beaches
   based on reasonable geographic parameters.
                                   5

   - Stock structure of nesting turtles has been identified using DNA analysis,
     flipper tagging, and satellite telemetry.
   - A mixed stock analysis of leatherback turtles along the California coast has
     been completed.
2. Each stock must average 5,000 (or a biologically reasonable estimate based on
   the goal of maintaining a stable population in perpetuity) females estimated to
   nest annually (FENA) over six years.
   - Efforts to attain this goal are ongoing.
3. Nesting populations at "source beaches" are either stable or increasing over a
   25-year monitoring period.
   - Efforts to attain this goal are ongoing.
   - Leatherback turtle population trends have been evaluated, and conservation
     strategies via stochastic simulation models have been designed and
     evaluated.
   - Monitoring and protection of leatherbacks nesting in Mexico and Costa Rica
     is ongoing. Currently, all primary nesting beaches in Mexico are protected
     (although egg poaching still exists), and secondary nesting beaches are
     partially protected.
   - Aerial surveys are being conducted to determine abundance of nesting
     leatherback turtles in Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Solomon
     Islands, and Latin America.
   - Monitoring and protection of leatherback nesting beaches in the western
     Pacific, including education of local villagers on the importance of
     conservation of leatherbacks have been supported. Locations included
     Papua New Guinea ("no harvest" moratorium set up on Kamiali Beach in
     2003; monitoring index beaches and tagging females), Indonesia (ongoing
     monitoring and protection, tagging, and telemetry), Solomon Islands
     monitoring), and Vanuatu (monitoring and protection of known leatherback
     nesting beach; surveying for other possible leatherback nesting beaches).
4. Existing foraging areas are maintained as healthy environments.
   - Efforts to attain this goal are ongoing.
5. Foraging populations are exhibiting statistically significant increases at
   several key foraging grounds within each stock region.
   - Efforts to attain this goal are ongoing.
   - Monitoring (aerial surveys) for foraging leatherbacks off central and
     northern California and the Pacific Northwest has been conducted.
   - The distribution and abundance of leatherback turtles within the coastal
     California ecosystem has been described.
6. All priority #1 tasks have been implemented.
   - The Marshall Islands Sea Turtle-Fisheries Interaction Outreach Education
     project to build sea turtle conservation and management capacity of the
                                   6

     Marshall Islands Marine Resources Authority has been supported (task
     2.1.1.1).
   - Satellite tags were attached to turtles in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia,
     Solomon Islands, and Latin America to gather information regarding
     migratory movements and pelagic habitat use (task 2.1.2.1).
   - National observer programs have been assisted and capacity building has
     been supported through in-country fishery observer training to improve sea
     turtle species identification, reporting, handling, and education regarding
     fishery mitigation techniques in Indonesia, Vietnam, and New Caledonia
     (task 2.1.4.1).
   - An observer program in the Chilean swordfish-directed longline fishery has
     been supported, and circle hooks and technical support have been provided
     for experimental testing of modified gear (task 2.1.4.1).
   - An observer program in Peru has been supported to document the threat of
     shark and mahi mahi longline fisheries on leatherback turtles and to
     document direct harvest (task 2.1.4.1).
   - Leatherback interaction rates and mortality rates in U.S. Pacific swordfish
     directed longline fleets have been reduced by requiring large circle hooks
     combined with non-squid bait; proper handling of hooked and entangled
     leatherbacks; and use of disentangling and de-hooking equipment such as
     dip nets, line cutters, and de-hookers (task 2.1.4.2).
   - A capacity building project for the Federated States of Micronesia National
     Ocean Resources Management Authority and the tuna longline industry to
     provide training on handling fishery-sea turtle interactions and to provide a
     foundation for future management activities has been supported (task
     2.1.4.2).
   - "Best practice technologies" have been promoted in the major longline fleets
     of the Pacific (task 2.1.4.2).
   - A project in Papua New Guinea to mitigate tuna and prawn fisheries
     interactions with sea turtles and to build the capacity of the National
     Fisheries Authority has been supported (task 2.1.4.2).
   - The efficacy of longline gear technology to reduce sea turtle interactions in
     Pacific Ocean high seas fisheries has been tested in collaboration with Japan
     (task 2.1.4.2).
   - Turtle interaction rates in the U.S. California/Oregon drift gillnet fisheries
     for swordfish and thresher shark have been reduced by implementing and
     enforcing a time/area closure in central and northern California in time/area
     of high leatherback concentrations (task 2.1.4.2).
7. A management plan designed to maintain sustained populations of turtles is in
   place.
   - Not yet completed.

2.3 Updated Information and Current Species Status
    2.3.1 Biology and Habitat
          The following sections provide an overview of leatherback research and
          population trends that have emerged in the past decade since the last 5-year
          review. This is not meant to be an exhaustive review, rather it aims to provide a
          comprehensive and updated background on population trends, demography,
          genetic structuring, and threats so that an appropriate listing classification may be
          evaluated for populations of the leatherback sea turtle.
          2.3.1.1 New information on the species' biology and life history:
                    This past decade has seen many technological advances and a diversity
                    of research that have allowed us to better understand the biology of
                    leatherbacks, especially away from the nesting beach. With the
                    extensive use of satellite transmitters and other data recorders, a vast
                    body of literature is now available on internesting and post-nesting
                    movements, behavior, physiology, and habitat use, which has been
                    valuable not only for a better understanding of leatherback biology, but
                    also for evaluating their exposure to and the impact of fisheries.
                    Molecular markers (i.e., mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites) have
                    greatly advanced our understanding of the genetic structuring within and
                    among ocean basins, both at the nesting beaches and at foraging grounds
                    (Dutton 1996; Dutton et al. 1999, 2002, 2006). Important contributions
                    have been made toward hypothesizing the impact of
                    climate/oceanographic processes on the contrasting population trends
                    observed between the Atlantic and Pacific (see below references).
                    Increased evaluation of bycatch worldwide has provided important
                    insights into the management of this species (see below references).
                    Stable isotopes are also beginning to play an important role in our
                    understanding of leatherback ecology (Godley et al. 1998a, Biasatti
                    2004, Wallace et al. 2006b, Paddock et al. 2007). Important research is
                    underway to estimate very important demographic parameters such as
                    age at maturity and survival rates (see below references). Furthermore,
                    density-dependent population regulation, a previously unexplored
                    subject in sea turtles, was evaluated in depth on a high-density
                    leatherback nesting beach in French Guiana (Girondot et al. 2002, Caut
                    et al. 2006a).
                    Research on many other different aspects of leatherback biology has
                    been conducted in the past decade. Some of the prominent topics
                    covered include:
                    • anatomy and physiology (Barragan 1996; Paladino et al. 1996;
                        Rostal et al. 1996, 2001; Penick et al. 1998; Davenport 1998;

  Rivalan et al. 2005b; Eguchi et al. 2006a; Avens and Goshe 2007).
• incubation environment and egg development (Godfrey et al. 1997;

  and Mantai 2003; Kamel and Mrosovsky 2003; Maharaj 2004; Ralph

  al. 2006; Gonzalez et al. 2006; Conrad et al. 2007);
• temperature-dependent sex determination and sexual differentiation
  (Leslie et al. 1996, Binckley et al. 1998, Chevalier et al. 1999,
  Herrera et al. 2004);
• nest site selection and nesting activity/patterns (Girondot and Fretey
  1996, Chevalier et al. 2000, Lux et al. 2003, Sieg et al. 2003,
  Weishampel et al. 2003, Pineda et al. 2004, Kamel and Mrosovsky
  2004, Nordmoe et al. 2004, Clune et al. 2006, Nolasco et al. 2007);
• hatchling emergence and orientation (Godfrey and Barreto 1995,
  Kloc et al. 1998, Standora et al. 2000, Drake and Spotila 2002,
  Villanueva Mayor 2002, Turnbull 2003);
• rehabilitation (Merigo et al. 2006);
• hydrodynamic drag (Hyman and Watson 2006);
• reproductive strategies (Dalton et al. 2007);
• research methodologies (McDonald and Dutton 1996, McDonald et
  al. 1996, Eckert et al. 1999, Torres 2003, Godfrey and Drif 2002);
• foraging ecology and habitat use (Salmon et al. 2004; Desjardin
  2005; Eckert 2006; Eckert et al. 2006; Harvey et al. 2006; Benson et
  al. 2006, in press);
• movement (Ferraroli et al. 2004; Hayes et al. 2004; James et al.
  2005a, 2005b; Eckert 2006; Eckert et al. 2006; Sale et al. 2006);
• management of leatherback populations (Tiwari and Dutton 2006);
• captive rearing of leatherbacks (Jones et al. 2007);
• evolution of leatherbacks (Wood et al. 1996; Dutton et al. 1996,
  1999); and
• bycatch (e.g., Moncada and Rodriguez 1996; Cheng and Chen 1997;
  Duguy et al. 1998; Godley et al. 1998b; Brito M. 1998; Horikoshi et
  al. 2000; Billes et al. 2003; Morisson et al. 2003; Dwyer et al. 2003;
  Pinedo and Polacheck 2004; Lewison et al. 2004; Kotas et al. 2004;

            2006; Bal et al. 2007).
        Other research has been directed toward developing tools to determine
        body mass from morphometric measurements (Georges and Fossette
        2006), correct for partial temporal and spatial monitoring effort on
        nesting beaches (Gratiot et al. 2006, Girondot et al. 2006), estimate tag
        loss (Rivalan et al. 2005a) and clutch frequency (Rivalan et al. 2006a),
        and analyze multiple satellite telemetry pathways and an animal’s
        navigation ability using state-space models (Mills Flemming et al. 2006,
        Jonsen et al. 2006).
        Basic nest count data collected consistently over a minimum of 10
        consecutive years have been very valuable for better assessing trends in
        leatherback populations as nesting female and nest count data of less
        than 10 years have recently been shown to be unsuitable for identifying
        leatherback population trends (Turtle Expert Working Group 2007).
        Methodologies to determine nesting numbers on the beach that correct
        for partial temporal and spatial monitoring effort (Gratiot et al. 2006,
        Girondot et al. 2006) and to estimate tag loss (Rivalan et al. 2005a)
        continue to be refined so that population trends can be determined more
        accurately. Similarly, much effort is being put into determining clutch
        frequency (Rivalan et al. 2006a, Briane et al. 2007). Clutch frequency
        has been difficult to evaluate because of incomplete temporal and/or
        spatial monitoring and the long-distance movements of leatherbacks
        within a season (e.g., Stewart et al. 2006, Hilterman and Goverse, 2007),
        and yet it is an essential parameter to estimate the number of females
        nesting in a season. Therefore, much effort has been expended to
        determine methodologies -- especially for nesting beaches where survey
        effort is low and varies among years -- to estimate this value as
        accurately as possible. Models have been developed to estimate clutch
        frequency from capture-recapture methodologies (Rivalan et al. 2006a)
        and to determine the distribution of the observed clutch frequency
        (Briane et al. 2007).
2.3.1.2 Abundance, population trends, and demographic features:
        2.3.1.2.1 Abundance and population trends:
        Pritchard (1982) estimated 115,000 females worldwide, of which 60%
        nested along the Pacific coast of Mexico. Spotila et al. (1996) later
        estimated that only 34,500 females (with confidence limits of 26,200 to
        42,900 females) remained worldwide. However, the most recent
        population size estimate for the North Atlantic alone is a range of
        34,000-94,000 adult leatherbacks (Turtle Expert Working Group 2007).
        Abundance and population trends (specified by either nesting population
                                 10

or total population where known) are summarized by each ocean basin
below.
INDIAN OCEAN AND SOUTHEAST ASIA
Hamann et al. (2006a) recently conducted a thorough assessment of
leatherbacks in all the countries of the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia
region and identified the following four leatherback nesting sub-regions
that may qualify as separate management units due to several factors,
including possible independent breeding assemblages and differences in
management regimes. Western Pacific countries and Malaysia were
included within the Hamann et al. (2006a) assessment of the Indian
Ocean and Southeast Asia and, although their synthesis is presented
here, these countries will be revisited in greater detail under the Pacific
section.
Southwest Indian Ocean - South Africa and Mozambique
South African index beaches demonstrated an increase from 10-20
nesting females annually in the 1960s to approximately 100 females
annually in the 1990s (Hughes 1996). However, in the past 4 years,
numbers have declined to 20 to 40 females nesting annually on the index
beaches (Hamann et al. 2006a). A recent evaluation of 42 years of
nesting data from South Africa found that nesting fluctuations make it
difficult to interpret population trends (Nel 2006). In Mozambique,
nesting numbers have not been well recorded, but estimates between
1994 and 2004 suggest that approximately 10 females nest per year in
southern Mozambique -- no increase in nesting has been observed in
Mozambique (Hamann et al. 2006a).
Bay of Bengal and Northeastern Indian Ocean - Sri Lanka, Andaman
and Nicobar islands (India), Thailand, and Sumatra-Java and other
islands of southern Indonesia and Arnhem Island (Australia)
Long-term data sets are not common in the countries of this region.
Hamann et al. (2006a) summarized the following information from this
sub-region: in Sri Lanka the nesting population may consist of 100 to
200 females annually (based on a year of data), whereas in the Andaman
and Nicobar islands there are approximately 400 to 600 females nesting
per year. Thailand supports about 10 nests per year. In Java, opposite
trends are observed in two neighboring rookeries -- Meru Betiri, nesting
numbers have declined from 20 females/year in the 1980s to less than
five females/year in the early 2000s, whereas at neighboring Alas Perwo
the nesting population possibly could have doubled over the same period
of time (from 500 eggs annually to 1,000 eggs annually) although clutch
                         11

frequency data for Alas Perwo are not available. Arnhem Island has not
been completely surveyed and known nesting is irregular.
Other Potential Nesting Areas in this Region
For the remaining potential nesting areas in this region, Hamann et al.
(2006a) summarized the following information. Some nesting has been
suspected in the past in Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Somalia, but there
are no current nesting accounts. Leatherbacks are rare along the
mainland coast of India -- there are only 13 records noted between 1923
and 2003. In countries like Kenya, no nesting has been recorded, but
only 50% of the coastline has been surveyed. Rare and anecdotal
accounts of leatherback nesting exist in the Philippines. In the
Seychelles, there have been two unconfirmed reports of leatherback
nesting, but no current reports. Only one leatherback nest has been
reported from the Chagos Islands in the 1970s, although since then
surveys have not found any evidence of leatherback nesting.
Community surveys in Vietnam indicate that nesting numbers have
dropped from 500 females per year (= thousands of nests) prior to the
1960s to less than 10 nests annually today (Hamann et al. 2006a,
2006b). Only two leatherback clutches have been recorded in Japan
after extensive surveys.
PACIFIC OCEAN
A dramatic drop in nesting numbers has been recorded on major nesting
beaches in the Pacific, although a sizeable nesting population exists in
Papua-Indonesia (Dutton et al. 2007, Hitipeuw et al. 2007). Spotila et
al. (2000) have highlighted the dramatic and possible extirpation of
leatherbacks from key nesting beaches in the eastern Pacific.
Eastern Pacific
In the eastern Pacific, the major nesting beaches are found in Costa Rica
and Mexico. At Playa Grande, Costa Rica, considered the most
important nesting beach in the eastern Pacific, numbers have dropped
steadily from 1,367 females in 1988-1989 (July-June) to 506 in 1994-
1995, and down to 117 by 1998-1999 (Spotila et al. 2000). At Parque
Nacional Marino Las Baulas, Costa Rica, which consists of Playa
Grande and the smaller nesting beaches of Playa Langosta and Playa
Ventanas, Santidrián Tomillo et al. (2007) analyzed data for the Park as
a whole for the first time and reported that leatherback numbers have
declined in the past 15 years of monitoring (1988-1989 to 2003-2004)
with approximately 1,504 females nesting in 1988-1989 to an average of
188 females nesting in 2000-2001 and 2003-2004.
                         12

In Pacific Mexico, Pritchard (1982) conducted an aerial survey of the
coastline and derived an estimate of several thousands of nesting
females. Monitoring on four primary index beaches for over 20 years
(1982-2004) has shown a decline in nest numbers. Tens of thousands of
nests were likely laid on the beaches in the 1980s, but during the 2003-
2004 season a total of 120 nests was recorded on the four primary index
beaches combined (Sarti Martinez et al. 2007).
Western Pacific
In the western Pacific, the major nesting beaches in Papua New Guinea,
Papua, Indonesia, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu (Limpus 2002, Dutton
et al. 2007), consist of approximately 2,700-4,500 breeding females.
However, this estimate should be interpreted with caution because it was
derived from nest counts, and reliable data on the number of nests per
female are not available (Dutton et al. 2007).
For a 2-km stretch at Kamiali, Papua New Guinea, also included in the
2004 survey, Benson et al. (2007a) counted 415 nests along the 4,516
km flown, with 71% of nests within the Huon Gulf coast. For a 2-km
stretch at Kamiali, Papua New Guinea, Benson et al. (2007a) reported
that between 2000/2001 and 2003/2004 the total number of females
estimated to have nested ranged from 41 to 71. Ground surveys at
Kamiali recorded a total of approximately 215 nesting events for
1999/2000 through 2003/2004 (Benson et al. 2007a). In the past, Quinn
and Kojis (1985) had estimated 10 turtles per night from November to
January, and Bedding and Lockhart (1989) had estimated 300 annually.
This suggests a decline in nesting numbers; however, the results should
be viewed with caution as this might be an artifact of sampling
inconsistencies.
Long-term data from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea are few.
Hamann et al. (2006a) estimated that the total nesting population is
approximately 1,000 females per year based on recent surveys at both
locations. In Papua, Indonesia, the main nesting beaches occur in
Jamursba-Medi and Wermon. Nesting numbers have dropped from over
13,000 nests recorded in 1984 at Jamursba-Medi (Bhaskar 1985) to
1,865-3,601 nests recorded between 2001 and 2004, which equates to
four nesting seasons. Between 1,788 and 2,881 nests were recorded at
Wermon between 2002 and 2004, which equates to two nesting seasons
(Hitipeuw et al. 2007).
In the Solomon Islands, 150 or more nests have been recorded on at least
four beaches, between 20-50 nests on four other beaches, and between
38-65 crawls (i.e., the sea turtle crawls onto the beach, but a nest is not
confirmed) on two more beaches (Kinan 2005).
                         13

In Vanuatu, recent nesting beach surveys and a review of leatherbacks
by Petro et al. (2007) indicate that the small nesting populations of
leatherbacks on these islands have declined significantly. Leatherbacks
nest on many of the islands, but it was estimated that 10-15 females
nested on what appeared to be the most important nesting beach. Other
potentially good nesting sites need to be thoroughly surveyed.
Information also exists for other nesting rookeries in the western Pacific.
In Malaysia, the major nesting rookery at Rantau Bang in Terengganu
has collapsed from over 10,000 nests in 1956 to 20 or fewer nests in
recent years (Chan and Liew 1996). In southeastern Australia, nesting is
sporadic with less than a handful of nests each year (Dobbs 2002). In
Fiji, Rupeni et al. (2002) estimated nesting by 20-30 individuals.
In eastern Australia, a small nesting site identified in the 1970s is
reportedly close to extirpation as no nesting has been recorded since
1996 (Hamann et al. 2006a). Nesting is irregular in northern Australia.
ATLANTIC OCEAN
Trends and abundances are provided below for seven leatherback
populations or groups of populations identified by the Turtle Expert
Working Group (2007) in the Atlantic: Florida, Northern Caribbean,
Western Caribbean, Southern Caribbean, West Africa, South Africa, and
Brazil. Although some authors have independently presented their
analyses of trends, and we have included them in the sections below, the
Turtle Expert Working Group (2007) undertook trend analyses
(regression and Bayesian) on Atlantic populations with a minimum of 10
years of nesting data and those results are included as well. Overall, an
increasing or stable population trend is seen in all regions except the
Western Caribbean and West Africa (for the latter, no long-term data are
available) (Turtle Expert Working Group 2007).
Florida
In Florida, a Statewide Nesting Beach Survey (SNBS) program has
documented an increase in leatherback nesting numbers from 98 nests in
1988 to between 800 and 900 nests per season in the early 2000s
(Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, unpublished data;
Stewart and Johnson 2006). Although the SNBS program provides
information on distribution and total abundance statewide, it cannot be
used to assess trends because of variable survey effort. Therefore,
leatherback nesting trends are best assessed using standardized nest
counts made at Index Nesting Beach Survey (INBS) sites surveyed with
constant effort over time (1989-2006). An analysis of the INBS data has
                         14

shown a substantial increase in leatherback nesting in Florida since 1989
(Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, unpublished data;
Turtle Expert Working Group 2007). The estimated annual growth rate
was approximately 1.17 with estimated confidence intervals of
approximately 1.1-1.21 (Turtle Expert Working Group 2007).
Northern Caribbean
In Puerto Rico, the main nesting areas are at Fajardo on the main island
of Puerto Rico and on the island of Culebra. Between 1978 and 2005,
nesting increased in Puerto Rico from a minimum of 9 nests recorded in
1978 and to a minimum of 469-882 nests recorded each year between
2000 and 2005 (R. Martinez, Puerto Rico Department of Natural and
Environmental Resources, unpublished data). Annual population
growth rate was estimated to be 1.10 with a growth rate confidence
interval between 1.04 and 1.12 using nest numbers between 1978 and
2005 (Turtle Expert Working Group 2007).
In the U.S. Virgin Islands, leatherback nesting on the Sandy Point
National Wildlife Refuge on the island of St. Croix has been monitored
each nesting season since 1977. The Sandy Point National Wildlife
Refuge has the most complete and consistent leatherback nesting data
set in the Caribbean. Dutton et al. (2005) estimated a population growth
of approximately 13% per year on Sandy Point from 1994 through 2001.
Between 1990 and 2005, the number of nests recorded has ranged from a
low of 143 in 1990 to a high of 1,008 in 2001 (Garner et al. 2005). The
average annual growth rate was calculated as approximately 1.10 with
an estimated confidence interval between 1.07 and 1.13) using the
number of observed females at Sandy Point, St. Croix, from 1986 to
2004 (Turtle Expert Working Group 2007).
In the British Virgin Islands, annual nest numbers have increased in
Tortola from 0-6 nests per year in the late 1980s to 35-65 nests per year
in the 2000s. Annual growth rate was estimated to be approximately 1.2
for nests laid between 1994 and 2004 (Hastings 2003, Turtle Expert
Working Group 2007).
Western Caribbean
Leatherback nesting along the Caribbean Central American coast takes
place between Honduras and Colombia (Troëng et al. 2004). Important
nesting areas occur in Costa Rica, Panama, and the Gulf of Urabá
(Duque et al. 2000) and La Playona (municipality of Acandí) in
Colombia (Patiño-Martínez et al. 2006). A small amount of nesting also
occurs in Honduras and Nicaragua (Lagueux and Campbell 2005). In
                        15

the past 10 years, an increasing number of projects have been initiated to
monitor leatherbacks in this region.
In Atlantic Costa Rica, at Tortuguero the number of nests laid annually
between 1995 and 2006 was estimated to range from 199 to 1,623;
modeling of these data indicated that the nesting population has
decreased by 67.8% over this time period (Troëng et al. 2007). Troëng
et al. (2004) found a slight decline in the number of nests at Gandoca
between 1995 and 2003, but the confidence intervals were large. Using
monitoring data between 1990 and 2004 at Gandoca, at the southernmost
end of Caribbean Costa Rica, during which time an average of 582.9 (+
303.3) nests were laid each season, Chacon and Eckert (2007) found that
nest numbers have been lower since 2000. The most important nesting
area for leatherbacks along the Central Caribbean coast is at Chiriqui
Beach in Panama where Ordonez et al. (2007) estimated approximately
3,077 leatherback nests and identified 234 individuals on surveys during
the 2003 and 2004 nesting seasons. Troëng et al. (2004) reported that
5,759-12,893 leatherback nests are deposited annually between the San
Juan River mouth (border between Costa Rica and Nicaragua) through
Chiriqui Beach, Panama, although this reported trend should be
interpreted with caution as it could be an artifact of interannual variation
in nest numbers. Nest numbers that were either derived mathematically
or observed were used to calculate the population growth rate for
Tortuguero, Gandoca, and Pacuare from 1995-2005, and the probability
that the population growth rate was >1 was 0.03, suggesting the
population was likely not growing (Turtle Expert Working Group 2007).
In the Gulf of Urabá in Colombia, 162 nests were recorded on a 3-km
beach during the 1998 season (Duque et al. 2000). On La Playona in
Colombia (a 3-km area that has been monitored since 1998), an average
of 120 new nesting leatherbacks has been tagged every year and an
average of 218 nests were laid between 1998 and 2005(note: no data
exist for 2000 and 2001; Patiño-Martínez et al. 2006). No trend
analyses are available in the literature.
Southern Caribbean
Nesting in the Southern Caribbean occurs in Guyana, Suriname, and
French Guiana (northern Brazil Guiana Shield) Trinidad, Dominica, and
Venezuela. Leatherback studies in the Guianas began in the 1960s, and
there is very little mention of leatherback nesting prior to this period in
the literature. Leatherback nesting has increased tremendously
throughout this region.
Leatherback work in Guyana began in 1965; however, because of the
shifting nature of beaches in the region and because of varying sampling
methodologies, data collection has not been consistent among years.
                         16

Nevertheless, better estimates of nest counts are available between 1988
and 2005 (P. Pritchard, Chelonian Research Institute, unpublished data)
and suggest that the population was likely increasing over that period
(see Table 11 in Turtle Expert Working Group 2007).
Spotila et al. (1996) estimated that over 40% of the world’s leatherback
population nests in Suriname and French Guiana, although the
magnitude of the West African rookery needs to be verified. Prior to the
1990s, population size was not studied in Suriname, but daily nest
counts have been conducted since 1969 with varying methodology over
the years, and possibly less survey effort in recent years. Hilterman and
Goverse (2007) identified 8,462 individual leatherbacks nesting in
Suriname between 1999 and 2005. Their estimate of the minimum
annual nesting number was between 1,545 and 5,500 females in
Suriname. Nesting in French Guiana has been cyclic with nesting
varying between approximately 5,029 and 63,294 nests annually
between 1967 and 2005 (Turtle Expert Working Group 2007). Rivalan
et al. (2006b) estimated a population of 2,750-20,000 individuals (males
and females of all life stages) from the Maroni (Suriname and French
Guiana). They determined that 90-220 individuals were needed to
maintain adequate genetic variance for adaptive evolution ("effective
population size"). Girondot et al. (2007) analyzed 36 years of nesting
data from French Guiana and Suriname and found that the population
can be classified as stable or slightly increasing. Using nest numbers
from 1967-2005, a positive population growth rate was found over the
39-year period for French Guiana and Suriname; the probability that the
population was growing was 0.95 (Turtle Expert Working Group 2007).
Trinidad supports an estimated 6,000 leatherbacks nesting annually,
which represents more than 80% of the nesting in the insular Caribbean
Sea (Fournillier and Eckert 1999, Eckert 2006). Intensive monitoring of
the north coast alone between 2000 and 2004 indicated a reliable mean
population size of 2,728 (1,949-3,410) nesting females per year;
evaluation of past data indicates a significant increase in population size
in the last 30 years (Livingstone and Downie 2005). Data on the number
of observed nests at Matura Beach in Trinidad (adjusted for number of
nesting females) from 1994 to 1999, as well as the actual number of
nesting female counts based on tag information for 2000-2005
(excluding 2002), indicated a positive trend over the time period. The
probability that the annual growth rate exceeded 1 was 0.81; the
Bayesian approach used suggested that the population was likely
increasing for the duration of the time series (Turtle Expert Working
Group 2007).
In Dominica, the three most important leatherback beaches were
patrolled from 22 April-15 December in 2003, from 1 March-30 October
                         17

in 2004, and from 17 March-30 September in 2005. Seven leatherbacks
were encountered and tagged in 2003, 18 in 2004, and 12 in 2005
(Franklin et al. 2004, Byrne and Eckert 2006).
In Venezuela, Hernandez et al. (2007) encountered 31 females and
counted 74 nests between March and August 2001 at Playa Parguito on
Margarita Island; no previously published information exists for this
beach. Over 200 nests were reported from other parts of Venezuela in
2004 (Mast 2005-2006).
Miscellaneous Caribbean: Based on data from the Wider Caribbean Sea
Turtle Conservation Network, according to the Turtle Expert Working
Group (2007), there are many locations in the Caribbean that cannot be
assigned to a particular population due to lack of nesting surveys and
genetic sampling. In the insular Caribbean, 0-25 nests are estimated per
year in Antigua, Bahamas, Barbados, Bonaire, Cayman (Grand, Brac,
and Little Islands), Cuba, Curaçao, Jamaica, Monserrat, Saba, St.
Barthelemy, St. Maarten, St. Martin, and Turks and Caicos. Between 25
and 100 nests are estimated annually in Anguilla, Aruba, Dominica,
Guadeloupe, and St. Eustatius. Between 100 and 500 nests are
estimated per year in Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St.
Vincent and the Grenadines (Eckert and Bjorkland 2004). In
Martinique, 150-200 nests are estimated to be laid each year. No trend
data are available because the time series are too short. These data are
summarized by the Turtle Expert Working Group (2007).
Brazil
Thome et al. (2007) analyzed nesting in Brazil between 1988-1989 and
2003-2004 and reported 527 nests during that time period although
annual numbers varied between 6 in 1993-1994 and 92 in 2002-2003. A
20.4% increase in nesting was observed on average annually between
1995-1996 and 2003-2004. Analyses of data between 1988 and 2003
found an estimated annual growth rate of 1.08 with the estimated 95%
confidence interval of 1.04-1.13; the probability of the population
increasing was greater than 0.99 (Turtle Expert Working Group 2007).
West Africa
Some nesting has been reported in Mauritania, Senegal, the Bijagos
Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau, Turtle Islands and Sherbro Island of
Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria,
Cameroon, Sao Tome and Principe, continental Equatorial Guinea,
Islands of Corisco in the Gulf of Guinea and the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, and Angola (summarized in Fretey et al. 2007a). A nesting
population is found on the island of Bioko (Equatorial Guinea). The
                        18

number of nests recorded on Bioko for 1996/1997 was 862 and 1,170 in
1997/1998 (Tomas et al. 2000). The mean number of nests recorded on
five nesting beaches of Bioko in 2000/2001 and 2004/2005 was 3,896
(range=2,127-5,071; Rader et al. 2006). In the People’s Republic of the
Congo, 70 leatherback nests were counted between October and
December during the 2003/2004 nesting season along 20 km of beach
(Renatura Report 2004), and at least 148 nests were recorded during the
2005/2006 nesting season (Renatura Report 2006).
The most important nesting beach for leatherbacks in the eastern
Atlantic lies in Gabon. Billes et al. (2000) estimated 30,000 nests along
96.5 km of Mayumba Beach in southern Gabon during the 1999/2000
nesting season. Billes et al. (2003) estimated that 6,300 females had
nested during the 1999/2000 season and 7,800 females during the
2000/2001 season, although it should be noted that the number of
females nesting may be a slight overestimate as clutch frequency may
have been underestimated. Furthermore, Sounguet et al. (in press)
conducted preliminary aerial surveys of 850 km of the Gabon coast in
2003 and estimated that 1,000-1,500 nests were laid on average every
night during the peak nesting months and that at least 30,000 nests are
laid along the Gabonese coast in a season. Preliminary data from the
2006-2007 collected by the Gabon Sea Turtle Partnership (unpublished
data) indicate figures consistent with the 1999-2000 season. However, a
steep decline had been noted during the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005
seasons. These estimates highlight the importance of this region and the
need to re-evaluate global population size in light of the greater
contribution from West Africa. Given the short-term nature of nesting
surveys in West Africa, it is not possible to conduct any trend analyses
for any of the populations in this region. Interestingly, similar
fluctuations have been documented for other nesting beaches in the
western Atlantic, such as Gondoca Beach (Chacón-Chaverri and Eckert
2007) and Tortuguero, Costa Rica (Troeng et al. 2004).
South Africa
Nesting has not been recorded in Atlantic South Africa. However, South
Africa is included under the Atlantic Ocean section, as well as the Indian
Ocean and Southeast Asia section, because adults from its nesting
population have migrated around the Cape of Good Hope into southeast
Atlantic waters (Hughes et al. 1998; Luschi et al. 2003b, 2006). For the
Indian Ocean coast of South Africa, data between 1963 and 1997
indicated an estimated annual growth rate of 1.04 with estimated 95%
posterior interval of approximately 1.03-1.05 (Turtle Expert Working
Group 2007).
                        19

MEDITERRANEAN SEA
Casale et al. (2003) reviewed the distribution of leatherbacks in the
Mediterranean. Among the 411 individual records of leatherback
sightings in the Mediterranean, there were no nesting records. Nesting
in the Mediterranean is not known or is believed to be extremely rare.
2.3.1.2.2 Demographic features:
Some demographic features that have received much attention are
discussed below.
Age at Maturity
Age at sexual maturity is an important demographic parameter for
management purposes and for developing recovery goals. The most
sophisticated analyses to date (skeletochronological data based on
scleral ossicles) suggest that leatherbacks in the western North Atlantic
may not reach maturity until 29 years of age (Avens and Goshe 2007).
New data contradict earlier estimates (Pritchard and Trebbau 1984: 2-3
years; Rhodin 1985: 3-6 years; Zug and Parham 1996: average maturity
at 13-14 years for females; Dutton et al. 2005: 12-14 years for
leatherbacks nesting in the U.S. Virgin Islands). Rhodin et al. (1996)
speculated that extremely rapid growth may be possible because
leatherbacks have evolved a mechanism that allows fast penetration of
vascular canals into the fast growing cartilaginous matrix of their bones.
However, it has not yet been determined if the vascularized cartilage in
leatherbacks serves to facilitate rapid growth or affect some other
physiological function. Age at maturity remains a very important
parameter to be confirmed as it has significant implications for
management and recovery of leatherback populations.
Survival
Reliable estimates of survival or mortality at different life history stages
are not easily obtained. The annual survival rate for leatherbacks that
nested at Playa Grande, Costa Rica, was estimated to be 0.654 for 1993-
1994 and 0.65 for those that nested in 1994-1995 (Spotila et al. 2000).
Rivalan et al. (2005b) estimated the mean annual survival rate of
leatherbacks in French Guiana to be 0.91. The annual survival rate was
approximately 0.893 (confidence interval = 0.87-0.92) for female
leatherbacks at St. Croix (Dutton et al. 2005). For the St. Croix, U.S.
Virgin Islands, population, the average annual juvenile survival rate was
estimated to be approximately 0.63, and the total survival rate from
hatchling to first year of reproduction for a female hatchling was
estimated to be between 0.004 and 0.02, given assumed age at first
                         20

reproduction between 9 and 13 (Eguchi et al. 2006a). Spotila et al.
(1996) estimated survival in the first year to be 0.0625. The longest
observed reproductive lifespan of 18 years has been reported from South
Africa (Hughes 1996).
Sex Ratios
Comparison of sex ratios of hatchlings at the nesting beach between
Atlantic and some Pacific populations suggests that Pacific populations
may be more female biased (Binckley et al. 1998) than Atlantic
populations (Godfrey et al. 1996, Turtle Expert Working Group 2007).
However, caution is warranted about making basin wide comparisons.
Only one study (Binckley et al. 1998) was conducted in the Pacific and
sex ratios may widely vary by beach or even clutch. Other studies
support a more narrow temperature regime for sex determination in the
Atlantic. Chevalier et al. (1999) compared temperature-dependent sex
determination patterns between the Atlantic (French Guiana) and the
Pacific (Playa Grande, Costa Rica) and found that the range of
temperatures producing both sexes was significantly narrower for the
Atlantic population. An examination of the available database of
strandings and in-water sightings from the United States’ Atlantic and
Gulf of Mexico coasts indicates that 60% were females, and that the
proportion of females among adults (57%; >145 cm curved carapace
length (CCL) and juveniles (61%; 100-145 cm CCL ) was similar for
these areas (Turtle Expert Working Group 2007). Although >145 cm
CCL is generally believed to be the size cut-off between juvenile and
adults, Stewart et al. (2007) reviewed published values and found that
females as small as 105-125 cm CCL were recorded nesting at various
cites (see also Godfrey and Drif 2002). Stewart et al. (2007) suggested
that smaller females should be considered when studying population
dynamics. Assuming the >145 cm CCL cut-off, the proportion of
females was greater along the Gulf of Mexico coast than the Atlantic
coast. James et al. (2007) collected size and sex data from leatherbacks
off Nova Scotia from 1999 through 2006. They found the size
distribution to consist mainly of large sub-adult and adults (n =152;
mean CCL = 148.1 cm) and a significant female biased sex ratio
(1.86:1). The proportion of females overall appears to have increased in
the strandings since the 1980s, but this pattern is less evident when
evaluated by region (i.e., north, south, and Gulf). In the Mediterranean,
United Kingdom waters, and along Atlantic France, overall there was no
strong female bias among strandings, sightings, and captures, whereas in
Atlantic Canada the sex ratio was 69% female for turtles greater than
145 cm CCL (James et al. 2007). Brazil also had a female biased sex
ratio (Barata et al. 2004).
                         21

2.3.1.3 Genetics and genetic variation:
        The leatherback is unique among sea turtles because it is the only extant
        survivor of an evolutionary lineage that diverged from other sea turtles
        100-150 million years ago (Zangerl 1980). Extinctions during the last
        Ice Age most likely reduced leatherbacks to a single lineage (Dutton
        2004). Although leatherbacks have a deeper evolutionary lineage than
        other sea turtle species, analysis of genetic data suggest low genetic
        diversity in the mitochondrial genome (Dutton et al. 1999) and a recent
        global radiation (Bowen and Karl 1996; Dutton et al. 1996, 1999).
        Hypotheses for low genetic diversity include population bottlenecks due
        to recent extinction, selection pressure that led to the replacement of
        recent ancestral mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and insufficient time to
        accumulate new mutations at the population level (Dutton et al. 1999).
        However, their probable lower philopatry and ability to disperse
        extensively and exploit higher-latitude waters because of their thermal
        tolerance adaptations (Frair et al. 1972, Greer et al. 1973) is thought to
        have allowed them to recolonize more rapidly than other chelonids.
        Molecular markers commonly used to establish genetic differences
        among populations are mtDNA and microsatellites, which are
        polymorphic nuclear markers. Microsatellites, in particular, can provide
        finer-scale resolution of leatherback population structure. Analyses of
        mtDNA from 10 nesting populations worldwide indicated shallow
        divisions both globally and within ocean basins (Dutton et al. 1999).
        The most divergent mtDNA haplotypes occur between the western
        Atlantic (Florida, Costa Rica, Trinidad, Suriname/French Guiana, St.
        Croix) and the eastern Pacific (Costa Rica, Mexico) (Dutton et al. 1999).
        Genetic structuring in each of the ocean basins is discussed below.
        INDIAN OCEAN
        A significant gap in knowledge remains concerning the genetic
        population structure of leatherback rookeries in the Indian Ocean.
        Published genotypes only exist for Malaysia, Papua, Indonesia, and
        South Africa (Dutton et al. 1999, 2007). It has been hypothesized that
        the nesting beaches in Sri Lanka and the Nicobar Islands might be part
        of a distinct Indian Ocean population (Dutton 2005-2006). Genetic
        sampling has been recommended from northern and eastern Australia,
        Andaman and Nicobar islands, Mozambique, Sri Lanka, Sumatra, Java,
        Thailand, and Vietnam (Dutton et al. 1999, 2007).
        PACIFIC OCEAN
        The rookeries in the eastern Pacific, Mexico, and Costa Rica are
        indistinguishable but represent a separate population from western
                                 22

Pacific populations (Papua, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Solomon
Islands) (Barragan et al. 1998, Barragan and Dutton 2000, Dutton et al.
2000b, Dutton 2005-2006). Mitochondrial DNA analyses of samples
from the Solomon Islands, Papua, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea
have revealed that these three countries comprise a metapopulation
consisting of a single genetic population (Dutton 2006; Dutton et al.
2007). The Malaysia nesting population comprises a distinct genetic
population, but may be extirpated now with the collapse of this rookery
(Chan and Liew 1996, Dutton et al. 1999, Dutton 2005-2006).
Genetic work (samples collected from Hawaiian longline and Western
U.S. driftnet fisheries) has also shown that leatherbacks from the
western Pacific are recorded in the North Pacific (Dutton et al. 2000b,
2002a, 2006). The north Pacific foraging grounds essentially comprise
animals from the western Pacific nesting population (Dutton et al. 1998,
2000b; Dutton 2005-2006), but leatherbacks from the eastern Pacific
generally forage in the southern hemisphere in the waters of Peru and
Chile (Donoso et al. 2000, Dutton 2005-2006). To date, approximately
29% of leatherbacks sampled off Chile (4 out of 14) have been identified
to originate from the western Pacific (Donoso et al. 2000; Dutton 2005-
2006, 2006; P. Dutton, NMFS, unpublished data).
ATLANTIC OCEAN
As previously mentioned, seven leatherback populations or groups of
populations have been identified by the Turtle Expert Working Group
(2007) in the Atlantic: Florida, Northern Caribbean, Western Caribbean,
Southern Caribbean (including northern Brazil), West Africa, South
Africa, and southern Brazil. Mitochondrial DNA data originally
indicated leatherbacks nesting in Trinidad were distinct from those
nesting in French Guiana and Suriname (Dutton et al. 1999); however,
recent studies based on larger sample sizes indicate genetic homogeneity
(P. Dutton, NMFS, unpublished data). Nuclear DNA and the recent
mitochondrial DNA data have now identified leatherbacks nesting in
French Guiana, Suriname, and Trinidad as one distinct genetic
population (Dutton 1995; P. Dutton, NMFS, unpublished data). The
Costa Rican population (Tortuguero and Gandoca) also appears to be
genetically distinct (Dutton et al. 1999; P. Dutton, NMFS, unpublished
data). Leatherbacks nesting on St. Croix were significantly different
from those from the mainland Caribbean (Dutton et al. 1999) suggesting
a northern Caribbean population, which may include Culebra Island and
Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, and the British Virgin Islands. Recent
microsatellite data from St. Croix suggest that first-time nesters may be
the offspring of females that nested on St. Croix more than a decade
earlier (Dutton et al. 2002b, 2005). Preliminary mtDNA results suggest
that leatherbacks nesting in Brazil may also be genetically distinct (P.
                         23

Dutton, NMFS, unpublished data; Vargas et al. 2007). In the eastern
Atlantic, West Africa, represented by Gabon, appears to be distinct as
does the rookery in South Africa on the Indian Ocean coast (Dutton et
al. 2003; P. Dutton, NMFS, unpublished data; LaCasella and Dutton
2007).
The populations mentioned above were distinguished primarily based on
genetic data. However, it is important to note that some nesting sites
have not been sampled (e.g., Guyana, Venezuela, Colombia, and
Caribbean islands, such as Grenada and Dominica), so precise
boundaries of these populations cannot be drawn. For example, it is not
clear where the boundary between the western Caribbean and the
southern Caribbean, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana/Trinidad,
northern Brazil population lies, since nesting beaches in between
(Panama, Colombia, and Venezuela) have not yet been surveyed. It is
likely that the South American and mainland Caribbean population
differentiation is clinal with French Guiana and Costa Rica
(Panama/Colombia, etc.) at opposite ends and an overlap (fuzzy
boundary) between intermediate sites (P. Dutton, NMFS, personal
communication, 2007). Tagging data also blur population boundaries
because of movements observed both within and among nesting seasons
(Turtle Expert Working Group 2007). For instance, some females from
Honduran and Colombian beaches were discovered on beaches in Costa
Rica (Troëng et al. 2004) suggesting one large rookery along the entire
coastline. Four leatherbacks tagged on the beaches of Costa Rica and
Panama were later found nesting in Cuba, Florida, St. Croix, and
Grenada, thereby weakening the concept of a distinct Western Caribbean
leatherback population. A female tagged on St. Croix nested in
Dominica, and a leatherback turtle tagged in Costa Rica was later found
on a beach in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida (see summaries available
in Bräutigam and Eckert 2006 and Turtle Expert Working Group 2007).
Leatherbacks foraging in the waters of the North Atlantic have been
shown to be part of the western Atlantic breeding populations (Dutton
2006; Roden et al. in press; S. Roden, NMFS, unpublished data).
MEDITERRANEAN SEA
There is no known nesting within the Mediterranean (Casale et al.
2003). Leatherbacks found in Mediterranean waters originate from the
Atlantic (P. Dutton, NMFS, unpublished data).
                          24

SUMMARY
In conclusion, genetic analyses of worldwide nesting assemblages
support the natal homing hypothesis, although natal homing in
leatherbacks lacks the relative precision observed in other sea turtle
species and allows for colonization of new or depleted beaches (Dutton
et al. 1999). Rivalan et al. (2006b) used microsatellites to evaluate
whether the lack of nesting records prior to the 1950s in French Guiana
and Suriname was the result of a long-term natural population cycle or
immigration; neither hypothesis was supported. Although genetic
studies failed to detect evidence of a founder effect or bottleneck in
French Guiana, Rivalan et al. (2006b) suggested immigration might be
important to maintaining a regional metapopulation; this requires further
investigation. They estimated the effective population to be 90-220
individuals for the French Guiana/Suriname population. Lynch and
Lande (1998) have argued that the effective population size for the
conservation of an endangered species should range from 500 to 1,000.
This indicates the vulnerability of the French Guiana/Suriname
population even though large numbers nest annually and also
emphasizes the need to preserve smaller populations that may be a
source rookery for depleted populations. The evolutionary effective
population size calculated from the mtDNA data globally was 45,000 to
60,000 (Dutton et al. 1999), whereas Spotila et al. (1996) estimated a
census size of 26,000 to 43,000 adult females globally.
Furthermore, microsatellites have indicated very infrequent or no
multiple paternity within or among successive clutches of a female
(Rieder et al. 1998, Dutton and Davis 1998, Dutton et al. 2000a, Crim et
al. 2002) suggesting that perhaps females rarely encounter multiple
males or that sperm competition may occur (Dutton et al. 2000a).
Leatherbacks at Playa Grande, Costa Rica, demonstrated some level of
polygyny (Crim et al. 2002), whereas no polygyny was detected in a
Caribbean population (Curtis 1998).
The observed low genetic diversity in leatherbacks and the potential
vulnerability of even large populations like French Guiana and Suriname
emphasize the need for conservation measures even when populations
are stable or increasing. Unique haplotypes contained in breeding
assemblages such as St. Croix account for a significant part of the global
diversity and are important to conserve and maintain genetic diversity
for the species as a whole.

2.3.1.4 Taxonomic classification:
        Kingdom: Animalia
        Phylum: Chordata
        Class: Reptilia
        Order: Testudines
        Family: Dermochelyidae
        Genus: Dermochelys
        Species: coriacea
        Common name: Leatherback sea turtle
2.3.1.5 Spatial distribution:
        Leatherbacks have the widest distribution of sea turtles, nesting on
        beaches in the tropics and sub-tropics and foraging into higher-latitude
        sub-polar waters. They have evolved physiological and anatomical
        adaptations (Frair et al. 1972, Greer et al. 1973) that allow them to
        exploit waters far colder than any other sea turtle species would be
        capable of surviving. In the Atlantic, they are found as far north as the
        waters of the North Sea, Barents Sea, Newfoundland, and Labrador
        (Threlfall 1978, Goff and Lien 1988, Marquez 1990, James et al. 2005a)
        and as far south as Argentina and the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa
        (Marquez 1990; Hughes et al. 1998; Luschi et al. 2003b, 2006) and
        nesting occurs in both the eastern and western Atlantic. In the Pacific,
        they extend from the waters of British Columbia (McAlpine et al. 2004)
        and the Gulf of Alaska (Hodge and Wing 2000) to the waters of Chile
        and South Island (New Zealand), and nesting occurs in both the eastern
        and western Pacific (Marquez 1990, Gill 1997, Brito M. 1998). They
        also occur throughout the Indian Ocean (Hamann et al. 2006a).
        Although leatherbacks occur in Mediterranean waters, no nesting is
        known to take place in this region (Casale et al. 2003).
        Historical descriptions of leatherbacks are rarely found in the accounts
        of early sailors, and the size of their population before the mid-20th
        century is speculative. Even for large nesting assemblages like French
        Guiana and Suriname, nesting records prior to the 1950s are lacking
        (Rivalan et al. 2006b). By the 1960s, several nesting sites were being
        discovered in the western Atlantic, in Pacific Mexico, and in Malaysia.
        Soon after, other populations in Pacific Costa Rica and Mexico were
        identified. It is difficult to explain the lack of published nesting
        accounts for these large reptiles, but this may result from a lack of
        publicity by indigenous people or lack of human habitation along
        leatherback nesting beaches. Today, as described above, nesting
        beaches are known in all major ocean basins with catastrophic declines
        observed in the eastern Pacific (Spotila et al. 2000) and Malaysia (Chan
        and Liew 1996).
                                  26

Important nesting areas in the western Atlantic Ocean occur in Florida
(USA); St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands; Puerto Rico; Costa Rica; Panama;
Colombia; Trinidad and Tobago; Guyana; Suriname; French Guiana;
and southern Brazil (Marquez 1990, Spotila et al. 1996; Bräutigam and
Eckert 2006). Other minor nesting beaches are scattered throughout the
Caribbean, Brazil, and Venezuela (Mast 2005-2006, Hernandez et al.
2007). In the eastern Atlantic, a globally significant nesting population
is concentrated in Gabon, with widely dispersed but fairly regular
nesting between Mauritania in the north and Angola in the south (Fretey
et al. 2007a). In the eastern Pacific, important nesting beaches occur in
Mexico and Costa Rica with scattered nesting along the Central
American coast (Marquez 1990). Nesting is very rare in the Gulf of
California (Seminoff and Dutton 2007). In the western Pacific, the main
nesting beaches occur in the Solomon Islands, Papua, Indonesia, and
Papua New Guinea (Limpus 2002, Dutton et al. 2007). Lesser nesting
occurs in Vanuatu (Petro et al. 2007), Fiji (Rupeni et al. 2002), and
southeastern Australia (Dobbs 2002, Hamann et al. 2006a) and is very
rare in the North Pacific (Eckert 1993). In the Indian Ocean, major
nesting beaches occur in South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Andaman and
Nicobar islands, with smaller populations in Mozambique, Java, and
Malaysia (Hamann et al. 2006a). For nesting numbers during the 2004
nesting season from 89 sites around the world, refer to the State of the
World’s Sea Turtles Report (Mast 2005-2006).
Despite decades of work on sea turtles and the presence of extensive
fisheries in all ocean basins, little is known about the dispersal and
developmental habitats of hatchling, juvenile, and subadult leatherbacks.
Eckert (2002a) summarized the records of nearly 100 sightings of
juvenile leatherbacks and found that animals less than 100 cm CCL are
generally found in water warmer than 26˚C indicating that the first part
of a leatherback’s life is spent in tropical waters. In the Gulf of Guinea,
a potential developmental habitat may have been identified in the waters
of Sao Tome and Principe where accidental capture of four juvenile
leatherbacks (17 to 21 cm in carapace length) in March 1994 were
reported (Fretey et al. 1999). Matings are not commonly observed, but
may occur near the nesting beach (Godfrey and Barreto 1998, Reina et
al. 2005). There appears to be some fidelity to breeding sites by males
(James et al. 2005b). Females have some degree of natal homing as
described in the above genetics section.
With the development and widespread use of satellite telemetry over the
past decade, more information is now available on the internesting and
post-nesting movements of adult leatherbacks. Internesting movements
and/or behavior, as well as data recording methodologies, have been
described from several nesting beaches (Eckert et al. 1996, 2002b, 2006;
                         27

Eckert 2006; Fulton et al. 2006; Wallace et al. 2005; Reina et al. 2005;
Eguchi et al. 2006b; Myers and Hays 2006; Billes et al. 2006b;
Hitipeuw et al. 2007; Shillinger et al. 2006; Benson et al. 2007a; Witt et
al. in press; Fosette et al. 2007). Post-nesting movements and oceanic
routes and habitat use have been greatly elucidated through satellite
telemetry and tend to support genetic studies and traditional tagging
data.
In the western Atlantic, widely dispersed post-nesting movements have
been elucidated by satellite telemetry (Ferraroli et al. 2004, Hays et al.
2004, Eckert 2006, Eckert et al. 2006, Sale et al. 2006; see Turtle Expert
Working Group 2007 for summary). Leatherbacks may select foraging
areas based on oceanic structures that may concentrate prey (Ferraroli et
al. 2004, Eckert 2006). Hays et al. (2006) demonstrated that during the
first year post-nesting leatherbacks generally do not tend to zone in on
fixed foraging hotspots, but appear to travel continuously and adjust
their foraging behavior and diel activity patterns according to local
conditions. Ferraroli et al. (2004) found that leatherbacks nesting in
French Guiana and Suriname disperse widely throughout the north
Atlantic -- there are no corridors -- and into eastern Atlantic waters.
Hays et al. (2004) also showed that leatherbacks nesting in Grenada
disperse widely, sometimes heading north and then perhaps into the
eastern Atlantic or directly across the Atlantic into eastern Atlantic
waters.
Tag returns and satellite telemetry of turtles from nesting beaches in
Caribbean Costa Rica and Panama have revealed that the leatherbacks
traveled through the Caribbean and into the Gulf of Mexico and the
North Atlantic where some remained close to the Atlantic coast of North
America and headed into the waters of Nova Scotia, Canada, or went
across the North Atlantic to north of the Azores Islands (Troёng et al.
2004, 2007; Evans et al. 2007). Post-nesting movements of leatherback
turtles tracked from Puerto Rico show wide dispersal into northwest and
northeast waters as well, with one leatherback up near North Carolina,
USA, and another traveling directly northeast to the Azores (Lutcavage
et al. 2003). Leatherbacks from Trinidad went across the Atlantic, either
through the Flemish Cap or thereabouts or straight across, ending
eventually in Mauritanian waters (Eckert 2006). Among leatherbacks
fitted with transmitters in Florida, most remained along the North
American continental shelf for three seasons and in winter moved off the
shelf. Another traveled to the Mauritanian coast and one to the north
equatorial Atlantic (Eckert et al. 2006). Satellite telemetry work has
shown that females as well as males and subadults foraging in the waters
of the North Atlantic make return migrations to key feeding areas in the
northern latitudes (James et al. 2005a). Research has also been
conducted on the behavior and diving patterns of these leatherbacks
                         28

during migration (James et al. 2005c, 2006b; Eckert 2006). Canadian
waters support the highest densities of leatherbacks in the summer and
fall in the North Atlantic (James et al. 2006c).
Many leatherbacks fitted with transmitters in Brazil headed south
(unpublished data from Projeto Tamar in Turtle Expert Working Group
2007). Leatherbacks have been reported from mid-South Atlantic
waters (White and George 2002).
In the eastern Atlantic, captures of leatherbacks from French Guiana,
Grenada, and Costa Rica have been reported (Girondot and Fretey 1996,
Troëng et al. 2004, Hays et al. 2004). Billes et al. (2006b) found that
female leatherbacks tracked from Gabon during the nesting season
performed extended movements into waters of neighboring Congo.
During their post-nesting migration, these leatherbacks either moved
offshore and headed toward the northern hemisphere to areas also shown
to be exploited by western Atlantic leatherbacks or remained relatively
close to the coast when heading to South Africa. Recent tag returns
have shown that leatherbacks nesting in Gabon travel to the waters of
Argentina and Brazil (Billes et al. 2006a), thereby highlighting the first
transatlantic east to west movements, as well as south to the waters of
Namibia and South Africa (Fretey et al. 2007c). Georges et al. (2007)
examined movements of satellite-tracked females from Gabon, Grenada,
and French Guiana during internesting intervals and after the nesting
season. In all locations, the females moved away from beach and
travelled hundreds of km between two consecutive nesting events,
indicating that leatherbacks disperse broadly during a nesting season.
Witt et al. (in press) found similar movement patterns in nesting females
at Mayumba National Park in Gabon. Internesting data indicate
leatherbacks can move from 2,000 to 4,500 km during the entire nesting
season. As in the western Atlantic, these animals may be using different
foraging grounds or traveling along different routes. A nesting
leatherback tagged at Bigisanti Beach, Suriname, in May 1970 was
recaptured in the waters of Ghana in April 1971 (Pritchard 1973).
In the Indian Ocean, leatherbacks nesting in South Africa sometimes
travel around the Cape of Good Hope into southeast Atlantic waters
(Hughes et al. 1998; Luschi et al. 2003b, 2006). Few data exist on the
foraging grounds and migratory corridors of leatherbacks in the Indian
Ocean and Southeast Asia region, although leatherbacks have been
reported from the waters of 32 of the 44 countries comprising this region
(Hamann et al. 2006a). Sale et al. (2006) describe the diving activity of
leatherbacks in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans.
In the western Pacific, satellite telemetry work has demonstrated
migrations of leatherbacks nesting in Papua, Indonesia, to the waters of
                         29

the Philippines and Malaysia, into the Sea of Japan, and across the
equatorial Pacific to temperate waters off North America (Benson et al.
2007b). The prevailing southward current suggests that the Raja Ampat
archipelago is an important migratory corridor and/or internesting
habitat for Papuan leatherback breeding populations (Hitipeuw et al.
2007). Leatherbacks from Papua New Guinea beaches headed into the
high latitude waters of the southern Pacific (Benson et al. 2007a). The
north Pacific foraging grounds have animals from both the eastern and
western Pacific rookeries (Dutton et al. 1998, 2000b; Dutton 2005-
2006), although leatherbacks from the eastern Pacific generally forage in
the southern hemisphere in the waters of Peru and Chile (Dutton 2005-
2006). Four of 14 leatherbacks from the western Pacific have also been
reported from Chile (Donoso et al. 2000, Dutton 2005-2006). Based on
stable isotope analysis, Paddock et al. (2007) suggested that leatherbacks
nesting in Papua, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea forage in the
western Pacific and the eastern Pacific. Leatherbacks tracked from
Monterey Bay, California, moved southwest, and one turtle was tracked
across the Pacific to north of Papua, Indonesia (Eckert and Dutton 2001,
Dutton et al. 2006).
The declining eastern Pacific genetic population is more limited to
foraging primarily in the southeastern Pacific. Genetic studies in Chile
and Peru (Donoso et al. 2000; P. Dutton, NMFS, unpublished data) and
telemetry studies (Morreale et al. 1996, Eckert and Sarti 1997) have
indicated that leatherbacks foraging in the southeastern Pacific are
primarily from the eastern Pacific nesting population. Shillinger et al.
(2006) tracked leatherbacks at Playa Grande, Costa Rica, and found
consistencies with earlier studies that suggested a leatherback "migration
corridor" along the Cocos Ridge from Las Baulas National Park toward
the Galapagos Islands (Morreale et al. 1996). One of the reasons put
forth for the greater collapse of eastern Pacific populations compared to
western Pacific populations is the difference in foraging strategies
demonstrated by satellite telemetry work, genetics, and tag returns. The
large nesting population in Papua, Indonesia, in the western Pacific uses
several foraging areas both near and distant, just like Caribbean
populations, whereas eastern Pacific populations have limited foraging
areas that occur primarily in the southeastern Pacific (Dutton 2006).
Luschi et al. (2003a) reviewed the role of ocean currents in various
ocean basins on long-distance movements of turtles and Gaspar et al.
(2006) advised that tracking data analyses should take oceanic currents,
usually neglected, into account to avoid misinterpretation of the animal’s
orientation and energy budget, as well the identification of foraging
spots. Lambardi et al. (2006) described how oceanographic conditions
may influence the migratory behavior of South African leatherbacks.

2.3.1.6 Habitat or ecosystem conditions:
        Many explanations have been provided to explain the disparate
        population trends seen in the Pacific and the Atlantic. Some ideas put
        forth to explain, for instance, disparate trends on the Pacific and Atlantic
        coast of Costa Rica include higher hatching success, less leatherback
        bycatch in fisheries, and less overlap between fishing areas and
        leatherback habitats in the Atlantic than in the Pacific (Troëng et al.
        2004). Using stable isotopes, Wallace et al. (2006a) calculated
        reproductive energy budgets for leatherbacks in the North Atlantic (St.
        Croix) and the eastern Pacific (Costa Rica) and found that resource
        limitation in the eastern Pacific due to the El Niño Southern Oscillation
        (ENSO) may be the cause of longer remigration intervals, thereby
        lowering reproductive success and increasing exposure to fisheries.
        Saba et al. (2007b) evaluated the effect of ENSO on the reproductive
        frequency of eastern Pacific leatherback turtles and reported that
        declines are not only due to fisheries causes but also due to sensitivity to
        the interannual climate variability, governed by ENSO, which is
        reflected in their remigration probabilities (higher remigration
        probability was seen during La Niña years than El Niño years). Variable
        remigration intervals result in variable egg production. During a La
        Niña year, increased oceanic productivity and favorable environmental
        conditions led to an abundance in turtles and shorter remigration
        intervals, possibly the result of improved leatherback prey availability
        allowing leatherbacks to reach reproductive condition more quickly
        (Reina et al. 2006).
        Wallace et al. (2006b) highlighted differences in nitrogen signatures
        between the St. Croix population in the Atlantic and the Costa Rican
        population in the eastern Pacific indicating fundamentally different
        oceanic processes. Saba et al. (2007a) found that mean primary
        productivity in all the foraging areas of western Atlantic females is
        significantly higher (150% greater) than those of the eastern Pacific
        females; the reproductive output of western Atlantic females was double
        that of eastern Pacific females. Except for the eastern Pacific, which had
        interannual variability in primary production because of ENSO, all of
        the foraging areas had seasonal primary production. High reproductive
        output and consistent and high quality foraging areas in the Atlantic
        have contributed to the stable or recovering populations in the Atlantic
        (Saba et al. 2007a).
        Several factors may contribute to the observed decline in the Pacific.
        Dutton (2006) highlighted the difference in foraging strategies between
        the eastern and western Pacific populations. While the large population
        in the western Pacific utilizes multiple nearshore and pelagic foraging
        areas in the northern and southern hemispheres, the eastern Pacific
                                 31

               population has a very narrow foraging strategy (by feeding primarily in
               the southeastern Pacific), thereby making it more susceptible to negative
               anthropogenic impacts and climatic stochasticity. The western Pacific
               population, in contrast, is better buffered against such perturbations
               (Dutton 2006).
2.3.2 Five-Factor Analysis (threats, conservation measures, and regulatory
      mechanisms)
      The determination to list a species under the ESA is based on the best scientific
      and commercial data regarding five listing factors (see below). Subsequent 5-year
      reviews must also make determinations about the listing status based, in part, on
      these same factors.
      2.3.2.1  Present or threatened destruction, modification or curtailment of its
               habitat or range:
               There are increasing impacts to the nesting and marine environment that
               affect leatherback turtles. Natural factors, including the recent tsunami
               in the Indian Ocean (see detailed report by Hamann et al. 2006c), impact
               leatherback habitat. Shifting mudflats in the Guianas also often make
               nesting habitat unsuitable (Crossland 2003, Goverse and Hilterman
               2003). Human activities also impact leatherback habitat. Leatherback
               nesting beaches are affected by development and tourism in several
               countries (e.g., Maison 2006, Hamann et al. 2006a, Santidrian-Tomillo
               et al. 2007, Hernandez et al. 2007). Structural impacts to nesting habitat
               include the construction of buildings and pilings, beach armoring and
               renourishment, and sand extraction (Lutcavage et al. 1997, Bouchard et
               al. 1998). In addition, accumulation of timber and marine debris on the
               beach, as well as sand mining, can have a negative impact on available
               nesting habitat in some areas (Chacón-Chaverri 1999, Formia et al.
               2003, Laurance et al. in press). These factors may directly, through loss
               of beach habitat, or indirectly, through changing thermal profiles and
               increasing erosion, serve to decrease the amount of nesting area
               available to nesting females, and may evoke a change in the natural
               behaviors of adults and hatchlings (Ackerman 1997; Witherington et al.
               2003, 2007). In addition, coastal development is usually accompanied
               by artificial lighting. The presence of lights on or adjacent to nesting
               beaches alters the behavior of nesting adults and is often fatal to
               emerging hatchlings as they are attracted to light sources and drawn
               away from the water (Witherington and Bjorndal 1991, Witherington
               1992, Cowan et al. 2002, Deem et al. 2007). In many countries, coastal
               development and artificial lighting are responsible for substantial
               hatchling mortality. Although legislation controlling these impacts does
               exist (Lutcavage et al. 1997), a majority of countries do not have
               regulations in place. Fortunately, some of the major nesting beaches
                                        32

occur in sufficiently remote areas, and large scale development is less of
an issue there.
Considering that coastal development and beach armoring is detrimental
to leatherback nesting behavior (Lutcavage et al. 1997), human
population expansion is reason for major concern. This is underscored
by the fact that over the next few decades the human population is
expected to grow by more than 3 billion people (about 50%). By the
year 2025, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) (2001) forecasts that population growth and
migration will result in a situation in which 75% of the world human
population will live within 60 km of the sea. Such a migration
undoubtedly will change a coastal landscape that, in many areas, is
already suffering from human impacts. The problems associated with
development in these zones will progressively become a greater
challenge for conservation efforts, particularly in the developing world
where wildlife conservation is often secondary to other national needs.
As leatherbacks forage widely in the oceanic habitat, modifications to
foraging areas are more difficult to monitor. However, their marine (and
nesting) environment is impacted by the petroleum industry. Numerous
oil platforms operate off Gabon. Billes and Fretey (2004) found debris
and tar balls that likely came from these operations.
An anthropogenic factor that may affect leatherback habitat and biology
is global warming. Impacts from climate change, especially due to
global warming, are likely to become more apparent in future years
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007a). The
global mean temperature has risen 0.76ºC over the last 150 years, and
the linear trend over the last 50 years is nearly twice that for the last 100
years (IPCC 2007a). There is a high confidence, based on substantial
new evidence, that observed changes in marine systems are associated
with rising water temperatures, as well as related changes in ice cover,
salinity, oxygen levels, and circulation. These changes include shifts in
ranges and changes in algal, plankton, and fish abundance (IPCC
2007b), which could affect leatherback prey distribution and abundance.
Global warming is expected to expand foraging habitats into higher
latitude waters (James et al. 2006a, McMahon and Hays 2006), and
there is some concern that increasing temperatures may increase
feminization on some beaches (Mrosovsky et al. 1984, Hawkes et al.
2007). However, because of the tendency of leatherbacks to have
individual nest placement preferences and deposit some clutches in the
cooler tide zone of beaches, the effects long-term climate change may
have on sex ratios may be mitigated (Kamel and Mrosovsky 2004).
McMahon et al. (2005) have fitted leatherbacks with sensors that capture
                         33

        water temperatures of their environment; these types of studies will be
        important for assessing temperature regimes that leatherbacks are
        exposed to. Of all the sea turtle species, leatherbacks are speculated to
        be the best able to cope with climate change because they have the
        widest geographical distribution of any reptile and show relatively weak
        beach fidelity (Dutton et al. 1999). Witt et al. (2006) investigated the
        impact of global warming on leatherbacks and their prey (i.e., jellyfish).
        Work has recently focused on how prey distribution that is primarily
        jellyfish aggregations may shape the distribution of leatherbacks on a
        temperate coastal shelf in the northeastern Atlantic (Houghton et al.
        2006, Witt et al. 2007). Analysis of leatherback sightings, strandings,
        and incidental captures from 1954 through 2003 indicates a seasonal and
        spatial overlap with aggregations of gelatinous prey in the northeast
        Atlantic (Witt et al. 2007). Houghton et al. (2006) suggest that 22.5% of
        leatherback distribution in the northeastern Atlantic can be explained by
        a spatial and temporal association with these prey. Basin scale changes
        to the North Atlantic Oscillation due to global warming will effect prey
        distribution and abundance. How this will affect leatherback
        distribution and foraging behavior is difficult to predict (Witt et al.
        2007). Grant et al. (1996) found a correlation between jellyfish and
        leatherback presence in nearshore waters off North Carolina.
2.3.2.2 Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or
        educational purposes:
        Egg collection occurs in many countries around the world (e.g., Chan
        and Liew 1996; Kinan 2002; Billes and Fretey 2004; Hamann et al.
        2006a, 2006b; de Dijn 2001; Hilterman and Goverse 2007; Troëng et al.
        2007; Fretey et al. 2007a; Santidrián-Tomillo et al. 2007; Bräutigam and
        Eckert 2006) and has been attributed to catastrophic declines such as in
        Malaysia. On some beaches (e.g., South Africa), egg harvests are now a
        thing of the past (Hamann et al. 2006a). Harvest of females still remains
        a matter of concern on many beaches (e.g., Fournillier and Eckert 1999,
        Hamann et al. 2006a, Ordonez et al. 2007, Fretey et al. 2007a,
        Bräutigam and Eckert 2006, Chacón and Eckert 2007, Gomez et al.
        2007). A traditional harvest of leatherbacks occurs in the Kei Islands
        (Suarez and Starbird 1996, Lawalata et al. 2006). Leatherbacks are also
        used in voodoo ceremonies and traditional medicine (Fretey et al.
        2007b), as well as religious ceremonies (Cheng and Chen 1997).
        Low hatching success is characteristic of leatherbacks despite high
        fertility rates (reviewed in Bell et al. 2003) and when additional
        anthropogenic or predation pressures are placed on incubating eggs, a
        management strategy commonly undertaken is nest relocation.
        However, many studies have found that hatching success of nests
        relocated to another section of the beach or to hatcheries is lower than in
                                 34

        situ nests (e.g., Duque et al. 2000, Hernandez et al. 2007); although
        another study found adequate hatching success in relocated nests at St.
        Croix (Eckert and Eckert 1990), which may be a factor in the increase
        observed in this nesting population (Dutton et al. 2005). The
        consequences of nest relocation need to be carefully evaluated
        (Mrosovsky 2006).
2.3.2.3 Disease or predation:
        The health status of and baseline blood indices for leatherbacks have
        been largely unstudied. Deem et al. (2006) presented the first baseline
        values for hematology, plasma biochemistry, and plasma protein
        electrophoresis from 35 leatherbacks nesting in Gabon and also
        measured plasma corticosterone, vitamin concentrations, and several
        toxicological parameters; the sampled leatherbacks were rated as being
        in good health. The first case of fibropapillomatosis in leatherbacks was
        reported from Pacific Mexico (Huerta et al. 2002). This disease is a
        condition likely caused by a herpesvirus (Ene et al. 2005) and is
        characterized by the presence of internal and external tumors
        (fibropapillomas) that may grow large enough to hamper swimming,
        vision, feeding, and potential escape from predators (Herbst 1994).
        Fibropapillomatosis is not as common in leatherbacks as in other sea
        turtle species (Huerta et al. 2002).
        Predators of leatherback eggs include feral pigs and dogs, (e.g., Ordonez
        et al. 2007, Hamann et al. 2006a, Tapilatu and Tiwari 2007, Hitipeuw et
        al. 2007), mole crickets (Maros et al. 2003), raccoons and armadillos
        (Engeman et al. 2003), monitor lizards (Tapilatu and Tiwari 2007),
        mongoose, civets, genets, and ghost crabs (Billes and Fretey 2004),
        jackals (Hughes 1996), dipteran larvae (Gautreau et al. 2007), and army
        ants (Ikaran et al. 2007). Predation on sea turtle hatchlings by birds and
        fish (see Vose and Shank 2003) has been commonly reported. Nellis
        (2000) reported predation on leatherback hatchlings by tarpons, and
        Vose and Shank (2003) reported hatchling predation by gray snappers.
        Jaguar (Troëng 2000) and killer whale (Pitman and Dutton 2004)
        predation on adults has been recorded. Sharks are also known predators
        of adult leatherbacks (Long 1996).
2.3.2.4 Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms:
        The highly migratory nature of leatherbacks requires international
        collaboration to ensure their survival. Several sea turtle specific treaties
        have been developed in recent years. These include the Inter-American
        Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles (IAC),
        Memorandum of Abidjan for conservation of marine turtles along the
        Atlantic coast of Africa (MoU Abidjan), Tri-National Partnership to
                                35

save leatherbacks in the Bismarck Solomon Seas Eco-region, Tri-Partite
Agreement (international agreement for the conservation of Caribbean
sea turtles), Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia Memorandum of
Understanding (IOSEA), and Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area
(TIHPA). Frazier (2007) discusses these treaties at length, except for the
Tri-National Partnership to save leatherbacks in the Bismarck Solomon
Seas Eco-region, which was recently drafted. These treaties are young
and hold much promise, despite their administrative, bureaucratic,
political, and financial constraints.
The recently-amended U.S. Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation
and Management Act (MSA), implemented by NMFS, mandates
environmentally responsible fishing practices within U.S. fisheries.
Section 301 of the MSA establishes National Standards to be addressed
in management plans. Any regulations promulgated to implement such
plans for fisheries, including conservation and management measures,
shall, to the extent practicable, (A) minimize bycatch and (B) to the
extent bycatch cannot be avoided, minimize the mortality of such
bycatch. Section 301 by itself does not require specific measures.
However, mandatory bycatch reduction measures can be incorporated
into management plans for specific fisheries, as has happened with the
U.S. pelagic longline fisheries in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
Section 316 requires the establishment of a bycatch reduction
engineering program to develop "technological devices and other
conservation engineering changes designed to minimize bycatch, seabird
interactions, bycatch mortality, and post-release mortality in Federally
managed fisheries."
There are many other agreements, treaties, and conventions that are not
sea turtle specific, but have implications for their survival: MEXUS-
Pacific (Mexico and USA bi-national agreement for living marine
resources conservation), Canada/Mexico/U.S. Trilateral Committee for
Wildlife and Ecosystem Conservation and Management, Convention for
Migratory Species (CMS), Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea, Protocol to the Cartagena
Convention concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW),
Bern Convention, Barcelona Convention, and the Convention for the
Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider
Caribbean Region (Cartagena Convention), to name a few. Hykle
(2002) and Tiwari (2002) have reviewed the effectiveness of some of
these international instruments. The problems with existing
international treaties are often that they have not realized their full
potential, do not include some key countries, do not specifically address
sea turtle conservation, are handicapped by the lack of a sovereign
                         36

        authority to enforce environmental regulations, and are not legally-
        binding. The ineffectiveness of international treaties and national
        legislation is oftentimes due to the lack of motivation or obligation by
        countries to implement and enforce them. A thorough discussion of this
        topic is available in a special 2002 issue of the Journal of International
        Wildlife Law and Policy: International Instruments and Marine Turtle
        Conservation (Hykle 2002). The legislative framework and
        management policies of Wider Caribbean countries are comprehensively
        reviewed by Bräutigam and Eckert (2006).
2.3.2.5 Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence:
        Among the anthropogenic factors affecting leatherbacks, boat strikes
        (Dwyer et al. 2003, Turtle Expert Working Group 2007) and the
        ingestion of plastics, balloons, synthetic materials, and fishing hooks and
        nets have been reported (Duguy et al. 1998, Starbird and Audel 2000,
        Bugoni et al. 2001, Barreiros and Barcelos 2001). Ingestion of marine
        debris can result in starvation, gut strangulation, and toxicity; however,
        more studies are needed to determine the physiological effects of
        ingesting these materials.
        Organochlorine contaminants, cadmium, copper, zinc, and toxic metals
        have been identified in leatherbacks, but it is difficult to interpret their
        effect on the health of this endangered species (Godley et al. 1998b,
        McKenzie et al. 1999, Caurant et al. 1999, Storelli and Marcotrigiano
        2003). Guirlet (2005) found high levels of organochloride pesticides in
        the sand of a French Guiana nesting beach, which may explain low
        hatching success on this beach (Girondot et al. 2007). Stewart et al.
        (2007) provided some of the first baseline contaminant concentrations in
        leatherbacks and found that contaminants are passed from nesting
        females to their eggs.
        A factor impacting leatherback populations worldwide is incidental
        capture in artisanal and commercial fisheries (e.g., Moncada and
        Rodriguez 1996; Cheng and Chen 1997; Duguy et al. 1998; Godley et
        al. 1998b; Brito M. 1998; Horikoshi et al. 2000; Billes et al. 2003;
        Morisson et al. 2003; Dwyer et al. 2003; Pinedo and Polacheck 2004;
        Lewison et al. 2004; Kotas et al. 2004; Petersen 2005; Eckert and Eckert
        2005; James et al. 2005a, 2005b; Lee Lum 2006; Marcovaldi et al. 2006;
        Carranza et al. 2006; Livingstone and Downie 2005; Gass 2006; Gilman
        et al. 2006; Zeeberg et al. 2006; Gallo et al. 2006; Fallabrino et al. 2000;
        Domingo et al. 2006; Hamann et al. 2006a, 2006b; Laporta et al. 2006;
        Bal et al. 2007; Santidrian Tomillo et al. 2007; Alfaro-Shigueto et al.
        2007; Fretey et al. 2007a; Georges et al. 2007; M. Griffin, Namibia
        Ministry of Environment and Tourism, personal communication, 2007).
        As an example, the decline in the Mexican population of leatherbacks
                                 37

has been suggested to coincide with the growth of the longline and
coastal gillnet fisheries in the Pacific (Eckert and Sarti 1997);
leatherbacks from this population migrate to the north Pacific and
southeastern Pacific where these fisheries operate (Eckert 1997, Dutton
et al. 2000b, Sarti Martinez et al. 2007). Lewison et al. (2004)
estimated that more than 50,000 leatherbacks were likely taken as
pelagic longline bycatch in 2000. Kaplan (2005) estimated that annual
longline mortality was 5% in the eastern Pacific population and 12% in
the western and central Pacific population, whereas coastal sources of
mortality that include harvest of eggs and females and bycatch by
inshore fishing gears was 28% in the eastern Pacific population and 13%
in the western and central Pacific population. Lee Lum (2006) estimated
that more than 3,000 leatherbacks were entangled by coastal gillnets off
Trinidad in the Southern Caribbean annually, with a 30% mortality.
Differences in bycatch rates among ocean basins may result from
different fishing gear and fishing practices or may simply reflect
divergent trends in the abundance of bycatch species among regions;
nevertheless, overall this bycatch level is not sustainable (Lewison et al.
2004).
The need to reduce bycatch of leatherbacks has led to many experiments
and new insights. Circle hooks with squid bait and J and circle hooks
with mackerel bait were found to greatly reduce leatherback bycatch
(Watson et al. 2005). For leatherbacks, neither daylight nor total soak
time had a significant effect on catch rates (Watson et al. 2005).
Leatherbacks are more likely to become entangled in the lines because
they are less maneuverable than other sea turtle species (Davenport
1987). It has also been suggested that the use of smaller circle hooks
with smaller gaps between the barb and shank will be effective in
reducing foul hooking of leatherbacks (Watson et al. 2005). Gless and
Salmon (2007) evaluated the responses of juvenile leatherbacks to lights
used in longlines and found behaviorally complex reactions as they
showed elements of attraction and repulsion to this stimulus.
Furthermore, the potential post-hooking mortality can be significantly
reduced with tools to remove hooks and line from the turtles (Watson et
al. 2005). Entanglement in fishing gear in waters adjacent to nesting
beaches has recently been identified as an important source of mortality
for leatherbacks, and male leatherbacks could be more susceptible to
entanglement in near shore fisheries because they do not appear to range
as far offshore as females at the nesting beach (James et al. 2005b).
Long-term telemetry data (Hays et al. 2004) suggest that leatherbacks
spend time diving to depths targeted by longline fishermen.
Over 3,000 leatherbacks are estimated to interact with the shrimp trawl
fishery each year in the U.S. (NMFS 2002). Turtle excluder devices
(TED) have been used in trawl gear in areas of the U.S. since the late
                         38

                       1980s. However, a morphometric analysis of stranded sea turtles on
                       beaches adjacent to fishing grounds indicated the TED escape opening
                       was too small to allow large turtles, including leatherbacks, to pass
                       through (Epperly and Teas 2002). Larger TED openings were not
                       required until 2003.
                       Besides longline and trawls, leatherbacks are known to interact with gill
                       nets, pots and traps, and pound nets (NMFS 2001). In temperate coastal
                       foraging habitats, fixed gear interactions are a major threat to
                       leatherbacks (James et al. 2005a).
2.4 Synthesis
    The East Pacific and Malaysia leatherback populations have collapsed. However, the
    most recent population size estimate for the North Atlantic is a range of 34,000-94,000
    adult leatherbacks, indicating stability (Turtle Expert Working Group 2007). See section
    2.3.1.2 for a summary of abundance and population trends by each ocean basin and
    appropriate references.
    Both natural and anthropogenic threats to nesting and marine habitats continue to affect
    leatherback populations, including the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean and
    development and tourism impacts on nesting beaches in several countries. Egg collection
    continues to occur in many countries around the world and has been attributed to
    catastrophic declines in some areas. In addition, the killing of nesting females still
    remains a matter of concern on many beaches. Despite relatively large numbers of
    females nesting in certain regions of the western Pacific, hatchling production remains
    low (Hitipeuw et al. 2007, Tapilatu and Tiwari 2007). A wide variety of species
    depredate leatherback nests worldwide (e.g., feral pigs and dogs, raccoons, mongoose,
    civets, genets, armadillos, monitor lizards, ghost crabs, mole crickets, and dipteran
    larvae). Incidental bycatch in artisanal and commercial fishing operations, including
    longline, gillnet, and trawl fisheries, is a major impact that is far from being resolved.
    Additional factors affecting leatherbacks include boat strikes, the ingestion of and
    entanglement in marine debris, and exposure to heavy metals and other contaminants in
    the nesting and marine environments.
3.0 RESULTS
    3.1     Recommended Classification:
            Based on the best available information, we do not believe the leatherback turtle
            should be delisted or reclassified. However, we have information that indicates
            an analysis and review of the species should be conducted in the future to
            determine the application of the DPS policy to the leatherback turtle. See Section
            4.0 for additional information.
                                                39

    3.2     New Recovery Priority Number: No change.
4.0 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE ACTIONS
    We have preliminary information that indicates an analysis and review of the species
    should be conducted in the future to determine the application of the DPS policy to the
    leatherback. Since the species’ listing, a substantial amount of information has become
    available on population structure (through genetic studies) and distribution (through
    telemetry, tagging, and genetic studies). The Services have not yet fully assembled or
    analyzed this new information; however, at a minimum, these data appear to indicate a
    possible separation of populations by ocean basins. To determine the application of the
    DPS policy to the leatherback, the Services intend to fully assemble and analyze this new
    information in accordance with the DPS policy. See Section 2.3 for new information
    since the last 5-year review.
    The current "Recovery Plan for Leatherback Turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the U.S.
    Caribbean, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico" was signed in 1992 and the "Recovery Plan for
    U.S. Pacific Populations of the Leatherback Turtle (Dermochelys coriacea)" was signed
    in 1998. The recovery criteria contained in the plans, while not strictly adhering to all
    elements of the 2004 NMFS Interim Recovery Planning Guidance, are a viable measure
    of the species status. The species biology and population status information can be
    updated; however, the recovery actions identified in the plans are appropriate and
    properly prioritized. While some additional recovery actions can no doubt be identified,
    the Services believe that the current plans remain valid conservation planning tools. The
    recovery plans should be re-examined over the next 5-10 year horizon, particularly if the
    DPS analysis results in restructuring of the current listing, to update the plans to conform
    to the 2004 NMFS Interim Recovery Planning Guidance. In the near-term, additional
    information and data are particularly needed on genetic relationships among nesting
    populations, impacts of coastal and pelagic fisheries, foraging areas and identification of
    threats at foraging areas, and long-term population trends.

                       Summary of peer review for the 5-year review of
                        Leatherback Sea Turtle (Dermochelys coriacea)
A. Peer Review Method: See B. below.
B. Peer Review Charge: On May 14, 2007, the following letter and Guidance for Peer
Reviewers of Five-Year Status Reviews were sent via e-mail to potential reviewers requesting
comments on the 5-year review. Requests were sent to William Coles (Virgin Islands
Department of Planning and Natural Resources), Dr. Scott Eckert (WIDECAST - Wider
Caribbean Sea Turtle Conservation Network), Dr. Angela Formia (Wildlife Conservation Society
- Gabon, Africa), Dr. Marc Girondot (University of Paris, France), Dr. Matthew Godfrey (North
Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission), Dr. Mike James (Dalhousie University, Canada), Dr.
Laura Sarti (CONANP - National Commission for Natural Protected Areas, Mexico), and Dr.
James Spotila (Drexel University).
We request your assistance in serving as a peer reviewer of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
and National Marine Fisheries Service’s (Services) 5-year status review of the leatherback sea
turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). The 5-year review is required by section 4(c)(2) of the United
States Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). A 5-year review is a periodic process
conducted to ensure the listing classification of a species as threatened or endangered on the
Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants is accurate. The initiation of the
5-year review for the leatherback turtle was announced in the Federal Register on April 21,
2005, and the public comment period closed on July 20, 2005. Public comments have been
incorporated into the status review.
The enclosed draft of the status review has been prepared by the Services pursuant to the Act. In
keeping with directives for maintaining a high level of scientific integrity in the official
documents our agencies produce, we are seeking your assistance as a peer reviewer for this
draft. Guidance for peer reviewers is enclosed with this letter. If you are able to assist us, we
request your comments be received on or before June 11, 2007. Please send your comments to
Sandy MacPherson at the address on this letter. You may fax your comments to Sandy
MacPherson at 904-232-2404 or send comments by e-mail to Sandy_MacPherson@fws.gov.
We appreciate your assistance in helping to ensure our decisions continue to be based on the
best available science. If you have any questions or need additional information, please contact
Sandy MacPherson at 904-232-2580, extension 110. Thank you for your assistance.
                                               Sincerely yours,
                                               David L. Hankla

                                         February 7, 2007
As a peer reviewer, you are asked to adhere to the following guidance to ensure your review
complies with Service policy.
Peer reviewers should:
1. Review all materials provided by the Service.
2. Identify, review, and provide other relevant data that appears not to have been used by the
Service.
3. Not provide recommendations on the Endangered Species Act classification (e.g.,
Endangered, Threatened) of the species.
4. Provide written comments on:
    • Validity of any models, data, or analyses used or relied on in the review.
    • Adequacy of the data (e.g., are the data sufficient to support the biological conclusions
        reached). If data are inadequate, identify additional data or studies that are needed to
        adequately justify biological conclusions.
    • Oversights, omissions, and inconsistencies.
    • Reasonableness of judgments made from the scientific evidence.
    • Scientific uncertainties by ensuring that they are clearly identified and characterized, and
        that potential implications of uncertainties for the technical conclusions drawn are clear.
    • Strengths and limitation of the overall product.
5. Keep in mind the requirement that we must use the best available scientific data in
   determining the species’ status. This does not mean we must have statistically significant
   data on population trends or data from all known populations.
All peer reviews and comments will be public documents, and portions may be incorporated
verbatim into our final decision document with appropriate credit given to the author of the
review.
Questions regarding this guidance, the peer review process, or other aspects of the Service’s
recovery planning process should be referred to Sandy MacPherson, National Sea Turtle
Coordinator, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, at 904-232-2580, extension 110, email:

C. Summary of Peer Review Comments/Report:
A summary of peer review comments from the four respondents is provided below. The
complete set of comments is available at the Jacksonville Ecological Services Field Office, U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, 6620 Southpoint Drive South, Suite 310, Jacksonville, Florida, 32216.
Dr. Scott Eckert, Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Conservation Network, Beaufort, NC: Dr. Eckert
provided numerous edits and several research papers not currently cited, but felt that the
biological information presented in the document was thorough. Dr. Eckert was concerned about
the proper use of citations for data used by the Turtle Expert Working Group (2007). He felt that
references to the Turtle Expert Working Group should only be used in those cases where the
group derived or uniquely compiled information; otherwise the original authors should be cited.
In Section 2.2.1, Dr. Eckert felt that a comparison between the recovery criteria and current
status should be made.
Dr. Angela Formia, Wildlife Conservation Society - Gabon, Libreville, Gabon: Dr. Formia
provided edits and several research papers not currently cited, but felt that the biological
information presented in the document was excellent. Dr. Formia’s main comment was that due
to differences in methodologies, the values provided on population trends and abundance are not
comparable, making it difficult to summarize broad comparisons. Dr. Formia recognized that
developing a summary with a standard unit may involve too many assumptions, but would be
valuable.
Dr. Matthew Godfrey, North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, Beaufort, NC, USA:
Dr. Godfrey provided edits and several research papers not currently cited, but felt that the
biological information presented in the document was comprehensive. Dr. Godfrey was
concerned about the use of unpublished sources of information; in particular he was concerned
about the use of the most recent Sea Turtle Symposium Book of Abstracts. He suggested that
these be changed to personal communications or unpublished data or be deleted. Dr. Godfrey
was also concerned about the lack of common values reported for population abundance and
trends. He also felt that values should be reported for similar years. Dr. Godfrey disagreed with
the statement that highly feminized sex ratios and the low probability of a female encountering a
male may be a cause of observed declines in the Pacific. He felt the statement was speculative at
this point, since there has been only one hatchling sex ratio study conducted in the Pacific and
extrapolating to the entire region was inappropriate.
Dr. Mike James, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada: Dr. James provided edits
and several research papers not currently cited, but felt the document was generally well written
and biological information presented was very current. Dr. James’ principal suggestion was to
present the summary information in tables and graphs to enhance the document’s accessibility to
the reader. Dr. James also disagreed with the statement that highly feminized sex ratios and the
low probability of a female encountering a male may be a cause of observed declines in the
Pacific. He felt the likely existence of specific mating areas and homing to such areas provides
an opportunity to mate even at low densities.
                                                  78

D. Response to Peer Review:
Dr. Scott Eckert, Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Conservation Network, Beaufort, NC: All of
Dr. Eckert’s edits and new information were incorporated except the request to change the
reference to the last status review in Section 1.3.4. The official citation is unchanged. The
Services agree that information from the Turtle Expert Working Group must be properly
referenced. We went through the document and where the Turtle Expert Working Group had not
derived or uniquely compiled data, we referenced the original authors. We did leave in some
references to the Turtle Expert Working Group where we felt the summary provided in their
report was helpful. Regarding Section 2.2.1, we added accomplishments under the Recovery
Criteria. In addition, the 5-year review provides new information on population status and trends
since 1995, and the five-factor analysis under Section 2.3.2 provides information used to
determine the appropriateness of the current listing status.
Dr. Angela Formia, Wildlife Conservation Society - Gabon, Libreville, Gabon: All of
Dr. Formia’s edits and new information were incorporated, except where she suggested
enhancements that would not change the analysis. Although we agree that presentation of data
could be enhanced by her suggestions, the Services are under time constraints to complete the
sea turtle 5-year reviews by the end of August 2007. The Services agree that differences in
methodologies present an obstacle to reporting values that can be summarized and compared.
We also agree that it may require assumptions that could compound errors. We maintained the
values reported by each study.
Dr. Matthew Godfrey, North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, Beaufort, NC, USA:
Dr. Godfrey’s edits and new references were incorporated. We agree that unpublished data are
less desirable than peer-reviewed and published data, and we have replaced or deleted citations
where published references or references with more rigorous peer review were available.
However in many cases the unpublished data, including the Book of Abstracts, were the best
available information, and those references were not deleted. Regarding values reported for
population abundance and trends, see response to Dr. Formia. We agree that highly feminized
sex ratios and low probability of encountering males as a causal factor in the Pacific declines is
speculative at this point; therefore, the statement was deleted.
Dr. Mike James, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada: Dr. James’ edits and new
references were incorporated, except for the request to include Ocean Spirits nesting data from
Grenada. The Services requested Ocean Spirits to provide citable data, but were unable to obtain
any new information. With regard to the suggestion that we add tables and graphs of summary
data to enhance the document, see response to Dr. Formia. We agree that highly feminized sex
ratios and low probability of encountering males as a causal factor in the Pacific declines is
speculative at this point; therefore, the statement was deleted.
